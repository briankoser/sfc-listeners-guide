Ben proclaims the start of The Sci-Fi Christian Golden Age. He returns to full-time hosting, while Daniel and Koby move to their own podcasts. Daniel appears mostly through voicemail as he calls in with news and commentary. Ben pretends to forget Koby's name and calls him everything but "Koby". 

The year starts with a bunch of interviews and long-promised guest hosts. Output, measured by both episode count and minutes, increases. Some of the show's most iconic episodes landed this season: The Fandom Menace, The Lost World of Genesis 1, What's In the Batcave?, Heroes Rants, and Excavating the X-Files. Ben introduces long-running segments Last News of the Day, Sci-Fi Christian Story Time, Ben is Right, and What the Frodo? Matt starts the first spinoff, The Bible Trivia Podcast. When the show goes on hiatus, the hosts record their first Top 50 countdown to fill the gap. 

On the personal side, Matt gets married, moving out of Ryan Strelau Studios and into BAM Studios. Ben enters the Catholic church and takes his family on the infamous Disney vacation, leading to the ultimate Story Time series.
