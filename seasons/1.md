When Ben and Matt started The Sci-Fi Christian, both were attending seminary and working at their church Epic Life, Matt as the youth director and Ben as pastoral ministry intern. They were already podcasting on their church's podcast The Life Report, but decided they wanted to also discuss pop culture and how it relates to Christianity. At the beginning, Ben ran the technical side and hosted the recording studio in his house (aka Rebel Underground Studios). News, main topic, and listener feedback were all included in each episode; by the end of the season they decided to break each out into its own episode. They focused on making sure every episode included both sci-fi and theology elements, leading to some hilarious shoehorning like "Top 5 Missionary Superpowers". At the end of the season, Ben decided to become a part-time host due to other obligations. They moved recording to Matt's apartment (Ryan Strelau Studios) and Matt became the main host and facilitator.
