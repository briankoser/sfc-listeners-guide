The SFC joins the Crossover Nexus. This mostly means that they mention the Crossover Nexus at the end of every episode for awhile, but it also resulted in a few episodes shared with other podcasts.

The Excavation of the X-Files continues and stalls. Series such as "Indiana Jones Theology" and "Virtual Ethics" get excellent follow-ups, while "Non-Fantasy Fantasy" and the alternate readings start.

Matt becomes a father! He thoughtfully schedules it for the end of the year during the traditional hiatus. This year's hiatus countdown is the greatest of them all: Sci-Fi Authors.
