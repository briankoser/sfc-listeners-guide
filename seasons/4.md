The SFC joins the Crossover Nexus. This mostly means that they mention the Crossover Nexus at the end of every episode for awhile, but it also resulted in a few episodes shared with other podcasts.

Ben christens it "The Year of the Pun" because they started using puns for episode titles.

The Excavation of the X-Files continues and stalls. Series such as "Indiana Jones Theology" and "Virtual Ethics" get excellent follow-ups, while "Non-Fantasy Fantasy" and the alternate readings start.

The Reinis release their book {% work "Flight of the Angels" %}.

Ben reveals his love for squirrels and starts the Ben De Bono Beer Show.

Matt quintuples his books read count from the previous year, and becomes a father! He thoughtfully schedules it for the end of the year during the traditional hiatus. This year's hiatus countdown is the greatest of them all: Top 100 Sci-Fi Authors.
