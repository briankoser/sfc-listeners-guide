The year is bracketed by movies: The Hobbit film trilogy finishes and Sci-Fi Movies is the hiatus countdown subject.

However, the year is dominated by books. Most notably, Ben produces hours of Divine Comedy videos then is joined by Matt for an iconic trilogy of episodes. The first Dune review, a discussion of Mark as apocalyptic literature, A Song of Ice and Fire, The Ocean at the End of the Lane, Anathem, and a couple Books of LOST (Watership Down and A Wrinkle in Time) combine to make this season untouchable on the literature front.

Ben pops up to the Reini's cabin for a weekend and came back alive. He also discovers that Mary Poppins is a witch.

Both hosts celebrate 4 years of podcasting and Episode 400.

Matt considers leaving the show (or at least podcasting less) after Episode 500.
