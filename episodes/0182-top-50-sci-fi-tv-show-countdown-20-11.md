  <q class="matt">See ya at the bachelor party. We didn't even talk about the bachelor party on story time!</q>
  <q class="ben">That's why I was showing you the people of Wal-Mart picture.</q>
  <q class="matt">OK. That makes sense.</q>
  <q class="ben">Maybe you need a stripper.</q>
  <q class="matt">No, I don't think I'd get one from Wal-Mart. And I should also clarify, we're not gonna get one, period.</q>

  <q class="matt">You don't have to go. You could just go eat food.</q>
  <q class="ben">I wanna, I wanna go.</q>
  <q class="matt">I don't want you to just complain about my bachelor party though. How about if you just go to the food and then you can go home.</q>
  <q class="ben">No alcohol, no smoking...</q>
  <q class="matt">I know.</q>
  <q class="ben">No strippers...</q>
  <q class="matt">Well, we're Christians, Ben.</q>

Matt planned his own bachelor party.
