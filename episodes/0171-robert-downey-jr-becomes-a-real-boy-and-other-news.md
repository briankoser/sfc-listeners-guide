What the Frodo: Robert Downey Jr. is playing Pinocchio and Gepetto in Ben Stiller's upcoming Pinocchio movie. 

{% timeLink {url:podcast_file_url, t:'14:38'} %} Matt says officially, no demons and no ghosts will be allowed on the air, unless it's a ghost of Matt's grandpa.

Stan Lee Quote of the Week: Spider-Man is the only hyphenated superhero, and he was hyphenated to differentiate him from Superman.



# Feedback

No one edited a Season 2 highlight reel. Matt invites the listeners to make a Season 3 highlight reel.



# Closing

Matt congratulates Ben for not swearing, which means he doesn't have to edit and can post the episode the next day.
