  <span class="quote-context is-size-6">Matt wants to own Batman 1966 on DVD but it's not available. Ben suggests he buy pirated copies.</span>
  <q class="matt">How about this, Ben: my birthday's in May.</q>
  <q class="ben">Yeah.</q>
  <q class="matt">Why don't you go ahead and buy me the pirated one.</q>
  <q class="ben">OK.</q>
  <q class="matt">Cuz I—here's a little behind the scenes on my faith: I can't bring myself to sin, but I don't mind if you do.</q>
</div>

Ben says there's no moral conflict in pirating content that's not available for purchase as long as you pay for it when it becomes available. <q class="archivist">It's certainly a grey area. Similar questions to ponder: is it OK to break the letter of the law if you uphold the spirit? For example, is it OK to rip your purchased DVDs so you can watch from a computer with no disc drive? Is it OK to pirate "orphan works" (e.g. a book where the author has died and no one knows who owns the copyright)? I don't think you can claim a right to do any of these things, but that doesn't necessarily make them immoral.</q>

Nicolas Cage is starring in a <i class="work-title">Left Behind</i> reboot film.

Matt hates <i class="work-title">Left Behind</i> and hopes Nicolas Cage kills the belief in the rapture.

Ben starts a contest: the first person to email him the answers to five trivia questions related to <i class="work-title">The Lord of the Rings</i> and pipe smoking can pick a book, movie, or TV show for Ben to watch and review.
