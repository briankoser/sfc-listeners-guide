# Main Topic

## Millennium
- Amillennialism - millennium is a metaphor for the Church Age
- Matt is currently tentatively amillennialist
- Post-millennialism - Church will establish millennium, at the end Jesus returns
- Pre-millennialism 
  - Jesus returns and establishes the millennium
  - Historic (no rapture, no tribulation) vs Dispensationalist (rapture and tribulation)
- Ben is currently historical premillennialist

## Tribulation
- Literal
- Metaphorical

## Final Judgment
- Sinners go to hell, Earth is destroyed, saved go to heaven
- Sinners go to hell, Earth is recreated/renewed, the saved are resurrected and live on Earth

## Rapture 
- A recent North American misinterpretation of [1 Thess. 4:17](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+thes+4%3A17&version=ESV)
- encourages apathy toward the state of the world

The Left Behind video game series might be the single dumbest thing Ben has ever heard of

Is dystopian fiction always post-apocalyptic fiction?
