  <q class="matt">Well, you know Jim Carrey is going to be in a superhero movie.</q>
  <q class="ben">{% work "The Mask" %}?</q>
  <q class="matt">No, he's in {% work "Kick-[bleep] 2" %}.</q>
  <q class="ben">Oooh. Wait, shouldn't you get bleeped for that, since you bleeped me for talking about Alexander Dumas last time?</q>
  <q class="matt">This is the first swear word you've probably ever heard me say.</q>
  <q class="ben">Yeah! Well, I think you said, 'what the [bleep]' earlier.</q>
  <q class="matt">Yeah, wow!</q>
  <q class="ben">But you were quoting something I had said, so that doesn't entirely count.</q>
  <q class="matt">Dang, OK, gotta write down the time code.</q>

  <q class="matt">Brandon, did you hear the episode where I had to bleep Ben out?</q>
  <q data-name="Brandon Gibbs">Which one?</q>
  <q class="matt">Yeah, exactly.</q>
  <q class="ben">Well, I've been—usually what has happened—</q>
  <q class="matt">The last two episodes.</q>
  <q class="ben">The last two?!</q>
  <q class="matt">Yeah.</q>
  <q class="ben">What did you have to bleep me for in the second one?</q>
  <q class="matt">Because I had—I played the clip—</q>
  <q data-name="Brandon Gibbs">I think I listened to that one today.</q>
  <q class="matt">Yeah, I played where you listened to André's—</q>
  <q class="ben">I said, 'what the [bleep]'!</q>
  <q class="matt">Yeah, exactly.</q>
  <q class="ben">That's not a swear word!</q>
  <q class="matt">I thought it would be funny—it makes it funnier—</q>
  <q class="ben">It sounds a lot worse.</q>
  <q class="matt">Yeah.</q>
  <q class="ben">Sometimes ambiguity is worse than actually just leaving it in there.</q>
  <q class="matt">It's actually pretty—it's a pretty funny clip.</q>
  <q class="ben">That's awesome.</q>
  <q class="matt">Yeah.</q>
  <q class="ben">André's going to be like—I'm never going to make friends with André now!</q>
  <q class="matt">The funny thing is, I just bleeped you out again, and so no one—still people won't know what you're saying.</q>
  <q class="ben">Oh. Uh, 'H-E-double-hockey-sticks'.</q>

Epic Life Church is now defunct, due to finances. Matt thinks it would be funny to restart The Life Report. 

<div class="quote">
  {% timeLink {url:podcast_file_url, t:'22:33'} %}
  <q class="matt">Yeah, so everybody, let's just bow our heads for a second.</q>
  <q class="ben">A moment of silence for The Life Report.</q>
  <q class="matt">I just want to have a moment of silence and pray for The Life Report.</q>
  <q class="ben">We're not going to pray for The Life Report.</q>
  <q class="matt">If you're in your car right now, just close your eyes and bow your head.</q>

Marvel is considering making a Heroes for Hire movie. Ben makes a stand: no more Marvel movies. 

Ben calls Ron Howard the most average director in the world.

Zeus, Ra, and Buddha team up for {% work "Godyssey" %}, a comic-book movie. The comic book also featured Jesus.

Matt observes that NBC has started doing short TV seasons like Ben called for two years ago.
