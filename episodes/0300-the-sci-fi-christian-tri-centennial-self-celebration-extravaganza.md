quotes:
  - time: "26:27"
    lines:
      - m: I'm gonna give my number 8 position to...Blades of Glory.
      - b: What!?
      - m: Starring Will Ferrell and Michael Cera.
      - b: What! Blades of Glory made your top ten movies!?
  - time: "31:02"
    lines:
      - m: Number 6.
      - b: Memento. Memento.
      - m: Aw, crap.
      - b: Is that number 10?
      - m: No, it's my new number 1.
  - time: "40:16"
    context: Ordinary People means a lot to Ben personally and is his favorite movie.
    lines:
      - m: So you're basically saying it was good for you at a certain period in your life, and so because of that now you hold it up a little higher?
      - b: No, it's also one of the best movies every made. Won the Oscar--
      - m: Technically, that's Citizen Kaine, but alright.
      - b: Well, I said 'one of the best'. I haven't seen Citizen Kaine.
      - m: Ah, I've seen Citizen Kaine, you loser! Ah, not so funny now, is it?
      - b: No, that's even worse, because you've seen Citizen Kaine and still put Blades of Glory ahead of it.
      - m: Yeah, it's not that good.
  - time: "1:04:27"
    context: Matt is ready with his genre movies list.
    lines:
      - m: They're ranked by a combination of nostalgia and actual goodness, but mostly just what do I like. Actually no, take that back. Nothing here is ranked by goodness on my list.
  - time: "1:29:53"
    lines:
      - m: That was a disaster.
      - benAction: "*laughing*"
      - m: That was a huge disaster.
      - b: That did not go well!
      - m: I never learn!
