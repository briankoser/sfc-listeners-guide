# Time Loop
Matt's theories are: dinosaurs/dragons still exist, and Bigfoot is an interdimensional being

  <q class="koby">My gosh.</q>
  <q class="ben">You're not arguing that dinosaurs still exist.</q>
  <q class="matt">No no.</q>
  <q class="ben">You're arguing that dragons exist.</q>
  <q class="matt">I'm actually arguing the dragons and dinosaurs are one and the same.</q>
  <q class="ben">That was the most messed-up theory that I have ever heard in my entire life.</q>

  <q class="koby">So, previous theories about how or what Bigfoot is, is that, it, uh...apes. OK?</q>

  <q class="ben">I feel like I just watched this episode, which was going along nicely, jump off a cliff. You just asked, wouldn't it be sweet if Bigfoot could talk to us.</q>
