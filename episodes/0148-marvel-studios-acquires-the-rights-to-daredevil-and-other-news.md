# Feedback
Taylor argues that oversaturation can only be defined in hindsight: as long as sequels are high quality, it's not oversaturation. For example, {% work "Star Wars" %} and {% work "The Lord of the Rings" %} got sequels.

Ben's says oversaturation means low quality and poor intent, not quantity.

<div class="quote">
  {% timeLink podcast_file_url, '47:25' %}
  <q class="ben">I don't hate anybody.</q>
  <q class="matt">Koby?</q>
  <q class="ben">I don't hate him! I think he's a fool...</q>
</div>

Ben is Right: John Wilkerson says oversaturation is a sin and asks for the Ben is Right song.
