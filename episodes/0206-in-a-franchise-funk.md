Why are there so few iconic characters from the 90s to present? 

Orson Scott Card says originality separates science fiction from other genres. 

Originality has not always been important for stories: mythology, oral tradition, and liturgy focus on retelling the familiar. 

Entertainment is not the main purpose of story.
