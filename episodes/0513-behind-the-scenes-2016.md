In Matt's high school film class, he watched {% work "Brazil" %}, {% work "Citizen Kane" %}, {% work "The Matrix" %}, {% work "Psycho" %}, and {% work "Rear Window" %}. He watched {% work "Memento" %} and {% work "Silence of the Lambs" %} as assignments.

Ben thinks it's a joke that {% work "Vertigo" %} is the best movie on the Sight and Sound best movies list.
