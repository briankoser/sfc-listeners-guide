last_listen: 2018-02-27
recommendation: yes-timeloop
recommendation_reason: The comics continuity discussion is mildly interesting, but there are some great moments including Ben's idea for fixing continuity and the post-end music singalong.
archivist_note: Matt arguing that Marvel continuity has never had a crisis is a semantics game. For example, <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heroes_Reborn_(comics)">Heroes Reborn</a> is totally a crisis, even though it was branded as a "rebirth"

# Main Topic
The continuity conundrum is that Marvel and DC continuity is convoluted and confusing.

## Solutions to the continuity conundrum
- Dave: Scrap the DC continuity
- Matt: Reduce number of Marvel titles, limit characters to one title
- Ben: Scrap the continuities, set a time limit of e.g. 10 years with the intent of having the story end and starting over again at the end

<q class="archivist"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Lantern:_Rebirth"  class="link-obvious">Green Lantern: Rebirth</a> was released in 2004, not 1994.</q>

## Superhero comic recommendations
- Dave: All-Star Superman, Green Lantern: Rebirth, Green Lantern: Sinestro Corps War, Identity Crisis
- Matt: Kraven's Last Hunt (Spider-Man), Civil War, Ultimate Spider-Man, House of M
- Ben: Joss Whedon's run on Astonishing X-Men

Ben is doing pastoral counseling over Google Chat while recording
