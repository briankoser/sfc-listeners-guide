Ben doesn't like that the show pushes ultra-individualism over responsibility, eg Peter walking out on his nursing job.

{% timeLink {url:podcast_file_url, t:'1:09:00'} %} Ben decided not to pursue a doctorate because it would have been too hard on his family. {% work "Heroes" %} helped him make the decision.
