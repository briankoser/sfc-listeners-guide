Ben doesn't like that the show pushes ultra-individualism over responsibility, eg Peter walking out on his nursing job.

{% timeLink podcast_file_url, '1:09:00' %} Ben decided not to pursue a doctorate because it would have been too hard on his family. {% workTitle "Heroes" %} helped him make the decision.
