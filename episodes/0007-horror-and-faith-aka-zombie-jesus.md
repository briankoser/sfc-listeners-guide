recommendation: yes-timeloop
recommendation_reason: Good discussion of how horror relates to Christianity.
archivist_note: "Ben's three subgenres of horror reminded me of Stephen King's three categories of horror: gross-out (eg gore), horror (eg zombies, jump scares), and terror (eg knowing something is behind you but you turn around and no one is there)."
