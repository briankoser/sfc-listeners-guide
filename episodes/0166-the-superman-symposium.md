Ben realized that Superman is an archetypal character and now appreciates him.

The first version of Superman was a bald villain.

Ben wants to modify Newman's Theory of Doctrinal Development to apply to comic book character adaptation.

Ben jokes that Superman is probably a Catholic. <q class="archivist inline">Actually, he's <a href="http://www.adherents.com/lit/comics/Superman.html">Methodist</a>.</q>

Patriotism to the extreme is wrong, as shown by Zod.

Rick says God doesn't recognize country borders. <q class="archivist inline">I don't think you can say that definitively. He definitely deals with countries separately in the Old Testament, which I think requires borders; the counter-argument is that he didn't explicitly condemn polygamy or slavery either. I suppose you could argue that Paul invalidated borders when he said "There is neither Jew nor Greek" (Gal. 3:28), but I would say that was not what he meant at all.</q>

  <q data-name="Rick Lee James">And I was a little worried...this is gonna sound maybe racist, but that we had Perry Black instead of Perry White.</q>
  <q class="matt">Ooh, you're right, that was racist. That was completely racist! Wow.</q>
