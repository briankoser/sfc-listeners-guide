Ben realized that Superman is an archetypal character and now appreciates him.

The first version of Superman was a bald villain.

Ben wants to modify Newman's Theory of Doctrinal Development to apply to comic book character adaptation.

  <q data-name="Rick Lee James">You know, basically the equivalent of a female superhero would wear, like, lingerie to fight crime in, you know--</q>
  <q class="ben">Well yeah, isn't that true?</q>
  <q data-name="Rick Lee James">I mean, that's what I would be more comfortable in, of course.</q>
  <q class="ben">Absolutely. In fact, Matt is wearing lingerie right now.</q>
  <q class="matt">I like to be comfortable when I podcast.</q>

Ben owns a Windows phone.

Ben jokes that Superman is probably a Catholic. {% arc %}Actually, he's <a href="http://www.adherents.com/lit/comics/Superman.html">Methodist</a>.{% endarc %}

Patriotism to the extreme is wrong, as shown by Zod.

Rick says God doesn't recognize country borders. {% arc %}He definitely deals with countries separately in the Old Testament, which I think requires borders. Maybe the counter is that Paul invalidated borders when he said "There is neither Jew nor Greek" (Gal. 3:28)?{% endarc %}

<div class="quote">
  {% timeLink {url:podcast_file_url, t:'1:44:52'} %}
  <q data-name="Rick Lee James">And I was a little worried...this is gonna sound maybe racist, but that we had Perry Black instead of Perry White.</q>
  <q class="matt">Ooh, you're right, that was racist. That was completely racist! Wow.</q>
