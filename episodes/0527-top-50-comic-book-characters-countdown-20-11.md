      - m: Do you ever just like something just because no one else does. And you're kind of like, this is kind of cool, I'm gonna like it--
      - b: Yeah.
      - m: Of course, who am I talking too? Of all my friends, I'm asking you this.

    lines:
      - m: Colossus.
      - b: Five.
      - m: Really like Colossus.
      - b: Yeah. He's Russian.
      - m: Yeah, I don't know why I'm such a big fan of him, but I like that character.
      - b: Which is funny because somebody who's that big, you wouldn't think would be very fast.
      - m: I don't get it.
      - b: But he's rushin'.
      - m: Is this a--I don't get this joke.
      - b: He's rushing. He's rushin'.
      - m: I don't think that was very funny.
      - b: I thought that was pretty good.
      - m: Yeah, it's not that good.

Ben hates Storm because his mom made him turn off the cartoon when she came on with her witchcraft. Also he doesn't like Halle Berry.

Ben's mom didn't let him watch {% work "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles" %} because they meditated. But Ben thought they were praying and put his turtle action figures in play prayer meetings, so she relented.
