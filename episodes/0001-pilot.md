The World Premiere! It's great to see where Ben and Matt started from at episode 1. Ben is much more optimistic, Matt is a little more combative. Both are enrolled in seminary in MN. At their church Epic Life (epiclifeonline.org), Matt is the youth director and Ben is pastoral ministry intern.

Ben reveals that they have a lifetime contract for the show.

<div class="quote">
<q class="ben">This is all about chemistry baby!</q>
<q class="matt">Not that kind of chemistry.</q>
</div>

The LOST Report addicted Ben to podcasting.

<div class="quote">
<q class="ben">Even before I got into Ministry, I am a lifelong nerd and completely Unapologetic about it.</q>
<q class="matt">I thought you were going to say, lifelong lover of Christ.</q>
<q class="ben">...That too.</q>
</div>

The show won't be strictly sci-fi, it will include all of genre fiction and topics.

Ben wants to do a Twilight episode (<q class="ben">It's cool that twilight is bringing people into geek culture.</q>)

They will have guest hosts over Skype to discuss topics they're not knowledgeable in.

They will report news, review movies and TV shows, and discuss philosophy and theology.

<q class="matt">I was surprised by how many people were offended by me saying that Jesus might have been a zombie.</q>

R2-D2 is the transition sound for everything.

Ben likes superhero movies and TV shows.

Saddest moment of the episode: how excited both hosts are about The Hobbit movie

Matt vowed to read The Hobbit before the movie comes out.

<q class="ben">I wish Spider-Man were in the Avengers movies.</q>

Matt said it would be crazy to buy comic books monthly.

Ben is looking forward to The Amazing Spider-Man.
