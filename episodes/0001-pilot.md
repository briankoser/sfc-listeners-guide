last_listen: 2018-01-22
recommendation: yes-timeloop
recommendation_reason: Lays a good foundation for where Ben and Matt were with their interests when they started the show.
archivist_note: The World Premiere! It's great to see where Ben and Matt started from in episode 1. Ben is much more optimistic, Matt is a little more combative.
