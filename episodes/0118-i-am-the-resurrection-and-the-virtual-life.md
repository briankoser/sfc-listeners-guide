    title: Five Potential Moral Issues with Living in a Virtual World
    ben:
      list:
        - Morality - morality seems to erode the further we get into a virtual environment
        - Justice - we neglect our duty to others
        - Identity - when we can be anything, identity becomes fluid and self improvement is unnecessary
        - Gnostic - embraces the gnostic worldview of flesh bad, spirit good
        - Eucharistic - communion grounds our worship in physicality

# Main Topic
What would be the ethics of choosing to live in a virtual world?

  <q class="matt">So do you recommend this book?</q>
  <q class="ben">Absolutely. Very entertaining.</q>
  <q class="matt">It's a Ben De Bono recommendation.</q>
  <q class="ben">Not terribly deep, but very entertaining. So, there you go. I do occasionally recommend something that's a bit lighter. It's about the depth level of {% work "Avengers" %}, but nobody's going around proclaiming it the greatest thing ever, so it doesn't make me mad.</q>
</div>

Would the Great Commission compel us to jack in to a virtual world if a large number of people "lived" there?

Could we have a church if a group of Christians decided to live in the virtual world?
