Ben makes "pow pow pow" sounds during the opening music.

What would be the ethics of choosing to live in a virtual world?

  <q class="matt">So do you recommend this book?</q>
  <q class="ben">Absolutely. Very entertaining.</q>
  <q class="matt">It's a Ben De Bono recommendation.</q>
  <q class="ben">Not terribly deep, but very entertaining. So, there you go. I do occasionally recommend something that's a bit lighter. It's about the depth level of <i class="work-title">Avengers</i>, but nobody's going around proclaiming it the greatest thing ever, so it doesn't make me mad.</q>
  <q class="archivist">Thus begins the most inexplicable anomaly in SFC history: Ben's love for <i class="work-title">Ready Player One</i>.</q>

Would the Great Commission compel us to jack in to a virtual world if a large number of people "lived" there?

Could we have a church if a group of Christians decided to live in the virtual world?

      <ol reversed>
        <li>Morality - morality seems to erode the further we get into a virtual environment
        <li>Justice - we neglect our duty to others
        <li>Identity - when we can be anything, identity becomes fluid and self improvement is unnecessary
        <li>Gnostic - embraces the gnostic worldview of flesh bad, spirit good
        <li>Eucharistic - communion grounds our worship in physicality

# Closing
Ben says they are in a Sci-Fi Christian Renaissance: there's a new member of the A Squad, he's back to recording every week, and they're releasing good episodes.
