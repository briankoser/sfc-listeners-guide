Ben presents the secondary reading that Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson are the same person.

Since the last episode, Ben realized that he is playing the [Sherlockian game](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherlockian_game).

# Holmes = Watson
Watson is an unreliable narrator.

Why would Watson be married so many times (possibly up to six)?

Why would Watson keep 221B Baker Street after Holmes disappeared over the Reichenbach Falls?
