  <span class="quote-context is-size-6">They discuss revival meetings and how they're like Billy Graham crusades</span>
  <q class="matt">In terms of slavery, churches started splitting before the country was split in half.</q>
  <q class="ben">Did you ever go to a...Billy Graham crusade, Matt?</q>
  <q class="matt">For some reason, because I was talking about slavery, I thought you were going to say 'plantation'. Then I would have said 'no' for sure.</q>
  <q class="ben">Well, you can go to plantations.</q>
  <q class="matt">I never went to a Billy Graham crusade. Have you?</q>
  <q class="ben">Well, if you go to the South, they still have some plantations open. Like, not--</q>
  <q class="matt">Where they have active slaves? Is that what you're saying?</q>
  <q class="ben">No! Like, you can go and tour them.</q>
  <q class="matt">With slaves and all?</q>

  <q class="matt">Ben. Geez. We talked about this on past episodes. I don't know if it was on the Life Report, but--</q>
  <q class="ben">Condition!</q>
  <q class="matt">It's not a condition! Just hold your nose!</q>
  <q class="ben">My nose condition.</q>
  <q class="matt">Just don't blow your nose on the show anymore. Please!</q>

Christian Scientists believe there is no evil and we're living in a dreamlike state. 

Ben doesn't like the taste of alcohol. Matt's experience with alcohol is one rum cake.

  <span class="quote-context is-size-6">Matt discusses Martin Luther King, Jr.'s efforts against injustices</span>
  <q class="matt">What many people don't realize is that his efforts went towards other injustices of every sort. For example, he was leading a poor people's march when he was assassinated in 1968.</q>
  <q class="ben">...whoops.</q>
