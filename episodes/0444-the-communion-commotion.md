# The Communion Commotion
Six areas of disagreement:

## What is it?
- A remembrance (Baptist)
- Sacramental union (Lutheran)
- Receptionism (some Protestants)
- Real Presence (Catholic, Eastern Orthodox)

Matt was confirmed in a Lutheran church.

## What does it do?
- Ordinance (Evangelical, Baptist, Pentecostal)
- Sacrament (everyone else)

Ongoing grace vs sanctification

## Who can take it?
- Anyone
- Any Christian
- Any member of a church
- Any member of a certain denomination

## Who can give it?
- Anyone
- Any Christian
- Any pastor
- Any formerly-ordained priest or pastor

Matt is an usher at his church.

## How often should it be given?

## What should we use?
- Anything
- Wine or grape juice
- Wine

Matt believes real presence without specifying how (Eastern Orthodox), sacrament, any Christian can take or give, likes once a week, wine or grape juice.

Catholics believe that the eucharist is how God provides salvation through the church. God can also provide grace in other ways (like to the thief on the cross).
