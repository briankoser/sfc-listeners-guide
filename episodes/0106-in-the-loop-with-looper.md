recommendation: no
recommendation_reason: Fine look at a good movie.
archivist_note: I was going to listen without having seen the movie, but I reconsidered when both hosts rated it highly and described it as "understated sci-fi". So I switched over to a baseball podcast about the MLB trade deadline. They mentioned that the Phillies had just acquired the obscure player Aaron Loup, which led to a brief discussion about the film <i class="work-title">Looper</i>. It was a sign. I watched it. 4.5 out of 5 stars.

Ben wants to start podcasting once a week again because he has a free night every week. He's a picky eater and so Annie made dinners that he didn't like while he was out of the house for school. She was annoyed that he was home every night of the week now that he's less busy with school, so she asked him to be out of the house one day a week.

<q class="archivist">Maybe there's an explanation I missed, but the existence of loopers seems like a major plot hole. It looks like the mob has control over the location when they send people back in time, so why not send people back into the furnace directly? Or into the ocean? Or 100 feet up in the air?</q>
