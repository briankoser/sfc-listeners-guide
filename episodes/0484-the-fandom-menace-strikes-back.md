What does it mean when fans start ordering art off a menu?

What is the relationship between art and fandom?

The fandom menace is that fandom is eclipsing the art itself.

1. People are happy to see their favorite characters, not necessarily happy about the story.
2. Nostalgia
3. Faith-based films

Matt got an emergency notification about the incoming storm. They pause the recording for about 10 minutes.

Ben has a moral problem with VidAngel, which allows you to automatically remove scenes or mute dialog with objectionable content. Accept art as the creator intended, or forgo it.

## Solutions
1. Be a thoughtful fan
2. Be a satisfied fan: know when enough is enough
3. Take your fandom to new places: seek greatness
