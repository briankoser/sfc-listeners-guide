recommendation: no
recommendation_reason: Instead watch the highlights on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGIErCzLlfI">YouTube video</a>. Ben at least later regrets doing this show in a debate format; both hosts were more focused on winning than on discussion. This doesn't make it a bad episode, but it could have been better.
