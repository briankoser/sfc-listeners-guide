  <q class="ben">Matt and Wayne, you two are the biggest <i class="work-title">LOST</i> fans I know. It's sickening. It's absolutely sickening how much you both love <i class="work-title">LOST</i>.</q>

Ben compiled 42 <i class="work-title">LOST</i> questions

Matt remembers thanking God for how good <i class="work-title">LOST</i> was. 

Final score: Wayne 11, Matt 18

Ben is disgusted at how easily Matt answered the questions after not watching the show in years.

  <q class="ben">I think the one that made me the most horrified (and I probably should have given you the point, but I didn't because it was just so disgusting) was when—this was a two-part question—what was Jacob doing when Locke is pushed out the window? And then the answer is "reading", which, OK, I thought maybe you would get that. But then my follow-up was, What is he reading? And I thought, there's no chance[...], and you didn't even let me get to the follow-up, you're just, 'He's reading Flannery O'Connor, and it's called, "Everything That's Something Must Converge".' It's like, what?! You've never even read Flannery O'Connor!</q>
  <q class="matt">That's true.</q>
  <q class="ben">This is ridiculous!</q>
  <q class="matt">That's 100% true.</q>
  <q class="ben">Do you even know who she is?</q>
  <q class="matt">I thought it was a boy! I didn't even know it wasn't a man! Oh, it's a girl?</q>
