  - "Todo: find the quote"

last_listen: 2018-02-19
recommendation: yes-timeloop
recommendation_reason: A shallow look at the Apocalypse, but notable for being the first time that Ben and Matt attack <i class="work-title">Left Behind</i>.
archivist_note: "It's amusing to hear Matt and Ben attack <i class='work-title'>Left Behind</i> with the fervency of the disillusioned. I was raised with the same eschatology and am currently undecided on the issue, but to play devil's advocate for dispensational premillennialism: prophecy is often vague, and if there's any area where the church could change doctrine \"late in the game\", it would be eschatology."

# News
Ben is now done with Stan Lee cameos and end credit scenes

<div class="quote">
  <span class="quote-context is-size-6">On the possibility of of {% work "The Dark Knight Rises" %} being scary</span>
  <q class="ben">Do you think you'll be able to get through it without holding my hand?</q>
  <q class="matt">I hope not.</q>
</div>

# Main Topic

## Millennium
- Amillennialism - millennium is a metaphor for the Church Age
- Matt is currently tentatively amillennialist
- Post-millennialism - Church will establish millennium, at the end Jesus returns
- Pre-millennialism 
  - Jesus returns and establishes the millennium
  - Historic (no rapture, no tribulation) vs Dispensationalist (rapture and tribulation)
- Ben is currently historical premillennialist

## Tribulation
- Literal
- Metaphorical

## Final Judgment
- Sinners go to hell, Earth is destroyed, saved go to heaven
- Sinners go to hell, Earth is recreated/renewed, the saved are resurrected and live on Earth

## Rapture 
- A recent North American misinterpretation of [1 Thess. 4:17](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+thes+4%3A17&version=ESV)
- encourages apathy toward the state of the world

The Left Behind video game series might be the single dumbest thing Ben has ever heard of

Is dystopian fiction always post-apocalyptic fiction?

  <q class="matt">Aw man.</q>
  <q class="ben">I think there is probably not such a universe.</q>
