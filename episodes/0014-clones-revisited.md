# Opening
Both are planning to attend Comic Con 2013



# News
Florida ended a program that gave red superhero capes to unemployed workers and encouraged them to fight the evil Dr. Unemployment.

<div class="quote">
  <q class="ben">This is Dr. Evil Unemployment down here.</q>
  <q class="matt">Wow. What does he have in his hand?</q>
  <q class="ben">He has pink slips!</q>
</div>

<div class="quote">
  <q class="ben">This might be the worst use of government money in the entire history of government.</q>
</div>



# Main Topic
What is a soul? 

<div class="quote">
  <q class="matt">It's the glowing ball inside of us.</q>
  <q class="ben">Oh! Is that what it is? So Iron Man clearly has a soul.</q>
</div>

Do animals have souls?

Is memory part of the soul? 

Are body and soul loosely or tightly connected? Are they meant to be intertwined or will we live in eternity without bodies?

When does the soul enter a new human body?

Is "physical, bad; spiritual, good" as Plato believed?

Death existed in the world since the beginning, but did not exist for God's image bearers until the Fall.



# Feedback
Ben finds a picture of George Lucas without a beard (instead of listening to Daniel Butcher's email)

"Roger" (actually Matt) called in and left <q class="ben inline">the dumbest voicemail we have ever received in the history of this show</q>. It might be the best SFC voicemail ever, and it includes this gem: 

<div class="quote">
  <q class="roger">So then I guess then the Holy Spirit would have to be a clone too.</q>
</div>
