Matt realizes before he starts that this isn't going to be a good episode. <q class="archivist inline">But it is going to be a great episode.</q>

## What's In The Batcave? 
Matt lists a bunch of things in the Batcave.

  <q class="ben">I am not a big Oracle fan.</q>
  <q class="matt">Why?</q>
  <q class="ben">I think she's a little lame...that was not intentional!</q>
</div>

<div class="quote">
  {% timeLink podcast_file_url, '7:51' %}
  <q class="matt">*trying to keep it together* He has a large bat colony, a Justice League teleporter, and a medical facility. *loses it* This is getting really bad!</q>
</div>

<div class="quote">
  {% timeLink podcast_file_url, '10:41' %}
  <q class="matt">Batman built retractable multi-walkway bridges, stairs, elevators—</q>
  <q class="ben">No he didn't. No he didn't.</q>
  <q class="matt">—and poles to access its facilities.</q>
  <q class="ben">No he didn't. OK, this is officially the hidden background of the Batcave: Batman executed a whole slew of workers who helped him construct all this crap. That is the only possible explanation. 'I don't kill! Unless it's to protect the Batcave.'</q>

  <q class="ben">Because he's my favorite comic book character and this is absolute nonsense. He's a buffoon! This is why Batman comics suck! This is why I don't read comics!</q>

How does the depiction of the Batcave affect how that version of Batman interpreted?
