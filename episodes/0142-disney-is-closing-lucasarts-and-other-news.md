  <span class="quote-context is-size-6">Ben reviews the questions for his contest</span>
  <q class="ben">And question 5: what was Tolkien's preferred pipe material? And you need to be specific there. Like you said, when you guessed, you said wood. I'm not saying whether wood is right or not, but wood, even if it was right, would not have counted cuz it's not specific.</q>
  <q class="matt">Like I would have had to have said like, pine wood.</q>
  <q class="ben">Well, yeah. So, briar pipes are pretty prominent, meerschaum, corncob, clay, metal, hardwood. Those are kind of the general categories. So I made that one multiple choice.</q>
  <q class="matt">Like, oak wood.</q>
  <q class="ben">No, I'm just—those are the categories. So: briar wood, meerschaum, corncob, hardwood, or clay.</q>
  <q class="matt">And like, another—like maybe birch wood.</q>
