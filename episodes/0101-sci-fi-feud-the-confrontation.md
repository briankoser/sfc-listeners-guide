Whoever finishes higher in the Podcaster Awards will be named the winner of the 2011 Sci-Fi Feud.

The loser has to record a promo for the other show and take a picture holding a sign that says, "I love [the other podcast]".

Matt also wants Twitterbot as a fifth host if they win. If Strangers and Aliens wins, they want the SFC to stop using Wikipedia.
