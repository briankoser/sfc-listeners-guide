Koby says array is a big word

Is God a time traveller? 

Is time travel compatible with Christianity? 

Koby doesn't like N. T. Wright

Could you interfere with God's plan by time travelling? <q class="archivist inline">Can you interfere with God's plan without time travelling?</q>

Is taking communion a form of time travel? 

Daniel says God isn't interested in removing the fall from the timeline, he's interested in restoring us.

[2 Peter 3:8](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Peter+3%3A8&version=ESV): God doesn't interact with time in the way we do

God existed before time

Will we track time in eternity?

God made time stand still for Joshua <q class="archivist inline">He also made time go backward for Hezekiah</q>

How does God see time? 

<div class="quote">
  <span class="quote-context is-size-6">Mere Christianity</span>
  <q data-name="C. S. Lewis">Almost certainly God is not in Time. His life does not consist of moments following one another. If a million people are praying to Him at ten-thirty tonight, He need not listen to them all in that one little snippet which we call ten-thirty. Ten-thirty-and every other moment from the beginning of the world-is always the Present for Him.</q>
</div>

Koby believes we invented time, that it's only a concept and a measurement.

Daniel counters with entropy, a way to measure time that's independent of humans. 

They agree that from man's perspective God travels through time, but from God's perspective he's not. 

Koby says God could create a rock so big He could not lift it.

Koby confuses himself reading what he wrote on the website.

Matt's theory on time travel is "whatever happened, happened": all time happens at once, you've already time traveled, already changed anything. Koby does not understand this theory.

Not a Scrooge scenario where it's observation only. <q class="archivist inline">Maybe the best way to explain this view would be to say: all of time happens/happened/is happening at once. We think the present is special because we're here, the past is set, and the future has not happened yet, but in this theory there's no difference between the three.</q>

When the prophets had a vision, were they time travelling?

Would God break the rule of time? 
Arc that's what we call a miracle

Daniel said Bill and Ted is the best and most important time travel movie of all time 

Koby thinks doctor who is completely ridiculous and really dumb

Phi. 3:13 God doesn't want us to meddle with the past through time travel

Matt said it is compatible, Koby said it's not


# Closing
Excerpt from one of Ben's sermons:

Paul says the end times are now, and that God has made the future come into the present.

60 seconds of silence 

The last 6 minutes of the show are the hosts trying to come up with episode title. <q class="archivist inline">Should have gone with "Quantum Leap of Faith" or "God's Excellent Adventure".</q>
