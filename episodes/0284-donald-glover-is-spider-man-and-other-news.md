# Opening

A listener said they like how Matt says the intro in time with the music. So he doesn't.

Ben was on the NFL Rants and Raves podcast as a Vikings correspondent. 

Matt wants all new original music for transitions.

Mike thinks Star Wars dropped in quality when {% work "Return of the Jedi" %} started taking inspiration from the first two films rather than myth.
