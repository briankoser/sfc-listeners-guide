Recorded in July 2010, this practice Life Report episode ("Episode 0") is the first time Ben and Matt recorded together.

Matt proposed the idea of a church podcast to Skip at Burger Jones in September 2009.

Ben and Matt met at Skip's house on Labor Day 2009.

Ben is the pastoral ministries intern at Epic Life.

Matt is a preschool worker, connector (greeter), records and posts sermons online, and leads a Life Group.

  <q class="ben">Me too. Yes, you will get lied to in a way you've never experienced before on this podcast, and it's gonna change your life.</q>
  <q class="matt">I like to call it, 'Epic Lie Church'.</q>
  <q class="ben">We could just take out the 'F' in our title and call it, 'The Lie Report'.</q>
  <q class="matt">Let's get the 'F' out!</q>

On the contrary, it...was welcomed with an array of mixed, lukewarm, and indifferent reviews... '</q>

The Throne Room scenes in <i class="work-title">Return of the Jedi</i> are Ben's favorite parts of Star wars
