Ben calls Koby "the Jar Jar Binks of The Sci-Fi Christian".

Matt says he probably won't have Koby on any more episodes with Ben. 

Ben decides to put Koby on Theo's List. He thinks a couple {% work "Batman and Robin" %} DVDs would be a fair trade.

# Main Topic
Star Wars movies will be released every year, alternating between episodes and standalones.

Ben starts a new crusade: oversaturation is immoral. The more that exists the less you can pay attention. So it might been a sin to release the History of Christianity episodes. 

Christopher Nolan will not be the executive producer for the entire DC cinematic universe.

Fox is banning people from selling Jayne's cunning hat.

Take That, Science: An Iranian created a "time machine" (it actually just predicts future events).

Take That, Science: scientists claim aliens put a secret genetic code in human DNA. 

Take That, Science: the speed of light in a vacuum can vary.

Stan Lee Quote of the Week: Stan rants about commercials

Matt decides to rent out the listener feedback episodes: for a donation they'll read extremely long emails like Noah's.
