# Feedback
Still using It's a Trap! transition

Matt leaves and Daniel and Koby talk about if Dracula was emo or not.

Koby's favorite superhero is Captain America. 

Koby says Batman is one of the worst superheroes, and actually is not a superhero because he doesn't have superpowers.

Koby doesn't like pancakes.
