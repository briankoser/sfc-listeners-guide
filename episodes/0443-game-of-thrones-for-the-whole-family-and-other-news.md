Netflix is developing a Legend of Zelda series as "Game of Thrones for the whole family".
{% arc %}First reported in {% episodeLink 332 %}{% endarc %}

# Feedback
Ben challenged the listeners to defend {% work "Superman" %} in {% episodeLink 8 %}. Five years later, Melissa listened to the time loop {% episodeLink 413 %} and gives it a go:

1. Theme song
2. Christopher Reeve
3. Jonathan Kent's death
4. Gene Hackman

Ben isn't convinced.
