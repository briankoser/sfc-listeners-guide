Moore's Law says computers will be powerful enough by 2050 to simulate every human mind that has ever existed.

If it's possible, it is possible we're already in a simulation. 

Who owns the new symphonies that AI Mozart writes?

Simulations could hypothetically end politics: if you disagree on policy, you could simulate both and choose the policy with better results. {% arc %}"Better results" is a value judgment, so I think you'd still have a place for politics.{% endarc %}

Ben says 750, Matt says 1113

{% arc %}They got to 729 in the main feed, plus 31 Patreon episodes. You could even fudge the numbers to get 750 exactly: 729 Main feed, 11 Extra, 9 Sports suite, plus 1 Bible Trivia episode. The uncensored episodes wouldn't have happened without Patreon, so those are left off.{% endarc %}
