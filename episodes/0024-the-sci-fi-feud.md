  <span class="quote-context is-size-6">A new Star Trek video game is announced</span>
  <q class="ben">Do you know what type of game it's going to be?</q>
  <q class="matt">I don't even know what that question means.</q>
  <q class="ben">Like, is it an RPG, is it a shooter, is it adventure?</q>
  <q class="matt">I don't know. It's probably like Mario Brothers where you just control the guy and go places.</q>
  <q class="ben">Yeah, you're not a video game fan are you?</q>
  <q class="matt">No. I mean, I know RPG means "role-playing gamer".</q>
  <q class="ben">...Oh my God.</q>
  <q class="matt">And I know shooter means you shoot things with a gun...when I played Raw vs Smackdown that was kind of a role-playing game...</q>
  <q class="ben">Do you understand the concept of a role-playing game?</q>
  <q class="matt">Yeah, you choose a role, like I'll be this wrestler, and then you play them, as that wrestler.</q>
