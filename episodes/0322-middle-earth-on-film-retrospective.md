# Opening
Matt has had Ben's Narnia cartoon DVD on his shelf for 2 years. He's going to watch it so they can do an episode comparing the three film versions of Narnia. 



# Main Topic
Ben points out that Matt rated {% work "The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies" %} {% stars 2.5 %} and the book {% stars 2 %}.

{% countdown countdowns.films %}

Evangeline Lily said all of the love triangle scenes were filmed in reshoots. 

{% work "The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers" %} is Matt's favorite because he thought Gimli was funny. 

{% countdown countdowns.worst %}

{% countdown countdowns.best %}

Peter Jackson went from being a respectful steward when making {% work "The Lord of the Rings" %} to feeling ownership over Middle Earth when making {% work "The Hobbit" %}.



# Feedback
Mike Poteet defends {% work "The Hobbit" %} movies.

Paul Lewis said Peter Jackson's cheesy dialogue and over-the-top visuals originated in his B horror movies.

Mickey likes Martin Freeman but says he played Tim from {% work "The Office" %} instead of Bilbo Baggins.

Taylor pointed out the Jackson had to simplify <i class="work-title">The Lord of the Rings</i> but expanded <i class="work-title">The Hobbit</i>.
