  <q class="ben">Matt, do you know what's going on here these days? What's going on here in Ryan Strelau Studios these days?</q>
  <q class="matt">There's something special in the air. There's something happening at The Sci-Fi Christian.</q>
  <q class="ben">It's the Golden Age of The Sci-Fi Christian.</q>

<q class="archivist">Off the top of my head, I think the only one either host ended up disliking was <i class="work-title">Farscape</i>.</q>

Ben says you have to embrace the cheesiness to enjoy <i class="work-title">Doctor Who</i>. He loves it. <q class="archivist">Not saying if you like one you have to like the other, but I think if you like <i class="work-title">Doctor Who</i> you could understand why people like <i class="work-title">Star Trek</i>. Both are cheesy, both are mainly successful because of the characters.</q>

Ben says <i class="work-title">The Wire</i> is the greatest show of all time.

  <q class="ben">The number one sci-fi thing I am not into but wish I was: <i class="work-title">2001: A Space Odyssey</i>.</q>
  <q class="matt">Yeah. I mean, I want to watch it. But you're not going to be into it, you just want to check it out.</q>
  <q class="ben">Yeah. I want to check it out. I have seen the part with the monkeys.</q>
  <q class="matt">I want to watch this with you then, cuz I've never seen it either.</q>
  <q class="ben">OK. I'm not going to watch it in one sitting. It's way too long.</q>
  <q class="matt">How long is it?</q>
  <q class="ben">It's like two and a half hours and the first forty minutes are just monkeys running around.</q>
  <q class="matt">Oh, never mind. Let's just watch it separately.</q>
  <q class="ben">'kay.</q>
  <q class="matt">OK. So yeah, I want to watch it. It didn't make my list—</q>
  <q class="ben">But it's a classic, I feel embarassed I haven't seen it all the way through, so definitely need to rectify that. And that's one where it's a low commitment, even though I'm not excited to sit through forty minutes of monkeys. Which literally, I'm not joking, it's like the first forty minutes of the movie are monkeys running around. And that's it, there's no dialog. You know, I'm excited to check it out sometime. Might fast forward the first part.</q>
</div>

Ben quit halfway through the last <i class="work-title">Sword of Truth</i> book. <q class="archivist inline">Very similar for me: I think our library didn't have the last 3 books. By the time they did I had come to my senses.</q>

{% timeLink podcast_file_url, '41:50' %} Sci-Fi Christian Story Time: Matt has a Zombie Nightmare

Ben says it's the creepiest story time the show has ever had.



# Closing
Ben is defending his thesis at the end of April. 

{% timeLink podcast_file_url, '47:58' %} Ben and Matt don't realize the mic is still on. They try to figure out when they should reveal that Koby isn't real, he's just a persona Ben plays.

<div class="quote">
  {% timeLink podcast_file_url, '49:37' %}
  <q class="ben">I mean, eventually someone's going to get it. There's no way that guy could be real. We made a Facebook page for a cat; who does that?</q>
</div>

<q class="archivist">The funniest idea in show history? When I first heard this years ago, it totally fooled me. I was only listening to the episodes that sounded interesting, so I had only heard Koby a few times, and hadn't seen any videos he was in.</q>
