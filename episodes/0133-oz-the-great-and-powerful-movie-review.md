Disney could only use material from the books, not things MGM copyrighted: the ruby slippers, the Wicked Witch's chin mole, the shade of green of the Wicked Witch's skin, and the swirl pattern that starts the yellow brick road. {% arc %}Copyrights have jumped the shark{% endarc %}

Matt agrees with Daniel's criticisms, but says he had a 4-star experience.

Daniel talks Matt down to 3.5 stars.
