</div>
<q class="archivist inline">First Koby <a href="/episodes/0084-sci-fi-feedback/">wouldn't</a>, now he couldn't.</q>

Matt says the opening like he has on a mask distorting his voice.

Matt is reading Brady's book, Alan and Aaron's book (<i class="work-title">Flight of the Angels</i>), a random non-listener's book, and Dave's book. And Ken sent an email asking Matt to review his book.

Matt promises to do more news episodes in 2013.

Some listeners, like Robin in the UK, have written in to say they prefer Season 1 with Ben to Season 2 with Daniel and Koby. Matt points out that, without Daniel and Koby, the Sci-Fi Christian might have died. 

Koby thinks Black Panther's superpower is that he turns into a panther.

Matt's favorite Bible version is the ESV.

It's been so long since they did feedback (six months) that they forgot what they covered and end up covering at least one email they already discussed.
