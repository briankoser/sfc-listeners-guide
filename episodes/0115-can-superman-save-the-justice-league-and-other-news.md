# Opening
Matt asked Ben for an outline for the next episode during the Super Bowl. Ben had too many beers to send it.

  <span class="quote-context is-size-6">Ben watched a football game with some friends.</span>
  <q class="ben">Alcohol makes you kind of tired, so I was just relaxed. We all thought—you know, the other three guys there were drinking as well, so everything was really funny, and it was a good time.</q>
  <q class="matt">Right now all of our listeners that were with us back in Season 1 are like, just praying that you'll become Protestant again.</q>
  <q class="ben">It's not gonna happen.</q>
  <q class="matt">Catholic Ben is so much more liberal with his theology and his character.</q>
  <q class="ben">No, the other three people there were Protestant, though.</q>
  <q class="matt">Who had drank the most though?</q>
  <q class="ben">Me.</q>
  <q class="matt">Yeah. Exactly.</q>

  <span class="quote-context is-size-6">Marvel cast a female actress in the next Captain America movie. No one knows what character she is yet.</span>
  <q class="matt">There's talks though that this actress might be related to—so like, he'll have dated the grandma and then dated the granddaughter. That's hot.</q>

  <q class="matt">John Chu might be the new director of <i class="work-title">Matched</i>.</q>
  <q class="ben">I have no idea who John Chu is.</q>
  <q class="matt">Do you want to know what <i class="work-title">Matched</i> is about?</q>
  <q class="ben">No, cuz I don't really like the young adult—</q>
  <q class="matt">You don't like that genre? We did a whole episode about it.</q>
  <q class="ben">We should do another one on it, because I kind of want to complain about it.</q>
  <q class="matt">That's why you want to do the next episode though, on fandom. We can't just do episodes when you want to complain!</q>
