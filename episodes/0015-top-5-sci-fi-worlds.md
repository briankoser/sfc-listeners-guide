Matt said he will read Beowulf.

# News

  <q class="matt">Our Wikipedia page is going to say, 'Nice podcast but they lie a lot.'</q>
</div>

Only Iron Man and Iron Man 2 have been released, and Ben is already worried that the MCU is prioritizing cleverness and connectedness over story. 

Superman renounced his American citizenship (the same week the US military killed Osama Bin Laden)

Maybe the worst title in the history of titles announced: Terminator 2012.
