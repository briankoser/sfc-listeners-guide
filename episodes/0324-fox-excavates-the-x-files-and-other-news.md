Fox is bringing back {% work "The X-Files" %}. Both hosts are cautiously in favor. Ben says they'd better finish the story and not do Monster of the Week episodes.

Stan Lee Quote of the Week: Marvel is combining the 616 and Ultimate universes. Stan Lee says it's good for stories to be unexpected and surprising.

{% work "The Avatar" %} sequels have been delayed.

Ben says {% work "Fantastic Four" %} will be terrible because Josh Trank appeared in a video game documentary and wore pink heart sunglasses the entire time.
