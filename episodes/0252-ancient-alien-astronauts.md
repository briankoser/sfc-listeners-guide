# Opening
They tried to record this episode twice but got too inappropriate. So they re-recorded the previous episode's outro to remove the tease to the content that went inappropriate and started recording this one a third time. 



# Main Topic

They first had the idea for this episode during Episode 2. Matt starts playing random clips from the episode, trying to find that moment. He gets it on the second try.

Are ancient aliens compatible with Christianity?
