# Opening
It's superhero week (here and on other Christian geek podcasts).

Robin in the UK won the pipe smoking contest.

## Contest answers

1. Frodo
2. Saruman and Bill Ferny
3. Gimli
4. Elves
5. Briar

Robin picked 5 episodes of <i class="work-title">Deep Space 9</i> for Ben to watch: "Emissary", "Way of the Warrior", "The Visitor", "The Ascent", and "In the Pale Moonlight". 

Ben starts another contest, same rules, same prize.

1. In the History of Christianity episodes, which historical figure's name does Ben claim sounds like it should be a swear word? 
2. Which book did The Life Report spend many of its final episodes discussing chapter by chapter? 
3. Who was/were the first person/people to be involved in a Sci-Fi Christian production besides Ben and Matt?
4. What activity does Matt claim he is too old for now that he has reached his 30s?
5. What was the date of The Life Report's first contest? (bonus points if you name the prize) 

<q class="archivist">The hosts eventually cancel this contest due to lack of participation. The questions are pretty difficult: 1 is easy, 2 I could find, 3 I'd have a harder time finding, 4 I don't remember at all and don't think I could find, 5 is currently not possible to find without The Life Report episodes.</q>



# News 
Koby debuted on Strangers and Aliens episode 67.

<i class="work-title">Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.</i> isn't out yet but Koby said it's already his favorite show.

  <q class="ben">He's making all these very compelling, intellectualy-honest, coherent thoughts, and I don't know what to do with this. And then he puts up the <i class="work-title">S.H.I.E.L.D.</i> trailer and says, 'It's my favorite show!', even though it doesn't debut for four months. And I wrote, 'There's the Koby we all know and love'. It's good to have you back, little buddy!</q>

# Feedback
Ben and Matt call the show's phone number and leave a voicemail for themselves.

Ben hates ellipses.

Daniel leaves a voicemail. 

Ben and Matt want to watch <i class="work-title">Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.</i> with Daniel and do weekly video reviews.
