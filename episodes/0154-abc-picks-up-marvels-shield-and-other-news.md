# Opening
It's superhero week (here and on other Christian geek podcasts).

Robin in the UK won the pipe smoking contest.

## Contest answers

1. Frodo
2. Saruman and Bill Ferny
3. Gimli
4. Elves
5. Briar

Robin picked 5 episodes of {% work "Deep Space 9" %} for Ben to watch: "Emissary", "Way of the Warrior", "The Visitor", "The Ascent", and "In the Pale Moonlight". 

Ben starts another contest, same rules, same prize.

1. In the History of Christianity episodes, which historical figure's name does Ben claim sounds like it should be a swear word? 
2. Which book did The Life Report spend many of its final episodes discussing chapter by chapter? 
3. Who was/were the first person/people to be involved in a Sci-Fi Christian production besides Ben and Matt?
4. What activity does Matt claim he is too old for now that he has reached his 30s?
5. What was the date of The Life Report's first contest? (bonus points if you name the prize) 

{% arc %}The hosts eventually cancel this contest due to lack of participation. The questions are pretty difficult: 1 is easy, 2 I could find, 3 I'd have a harder time finding, 4 I don't remember at all and don't think I could find, 5 is currently not possible to find without The Life Report episodes.{% endarc %}

It's good to have you back, little buddy!</q>
