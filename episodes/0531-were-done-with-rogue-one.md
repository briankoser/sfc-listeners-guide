# How to Fix the Movie

- Expand the timeline by moving the start of the movie 10 years earlier.
- Flesh out the characters.
- Third act is heist instead of a battle.
- Leia is not directly involved in the heist.
- One member of the team turns the others in to the Empire.
- The escape ship is damaged and can't rendezvous with the Rebellion. Donny Yen uses the Force, which guides their hyperspace jump to Tatooine.
- Dying act is to pass the plans to Leia. Darth Vader intercepts because the traitor put a tracker on the escape ship.
- The main characters are imprisoned on the Death Star. The movie ends where A New Hope ends, with the Death Star blowing up, but now the moment is bittersweet.


# Closing
Donations are up to $3,800 for One Day's Wages. Ben still says they won't make the $5,000 goal.
