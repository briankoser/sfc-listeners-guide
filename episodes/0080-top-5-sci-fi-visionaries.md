Visionaries vs Creators

Joss Whedon did great things, but not things never before seen.

The Wachowski Brothers blew minds with {% work "The Matrix" %}, but their other work has been low quality.

Great creators will always have top quality. Great visionaries may not. 

More examples:
- Christopher Nolan - great creator
- Tim Burton - great visionary

  <span class="quote-context is-size-6">Ben says China Mieville describes monsters you can hardly imagine.</span>
  <q class="matt">Give us one. Like a monster that he created that now everybody know about.</q>
  <q class="ben">I don't think there's one everybody knows about. They just kind of exist in his--</q>
  <q class="matt">Like, he didn't create Godzilla?</q>
  <q class="ben">No, he didn't create Godzilla.</q>
  <q class="matt">You said his name was "China" though, right?</q>
  <q class="ben">Yeah, but that was Japan.</q>
  <q class="matt">I know, but it's nearby.</q>
  <q class="ben">Ah, Asia's all the same...do we have to edit that out?</q>
  <q class="matt">I'm just going to let that hang. I'm not going to edit that out. I don't support that belief--</q>
  <q class="ben">Neither do I!</q>
  <q class="matt">I'm not editing that out.</q>
  <q class="ben">That's fine.</q>
  <q class="matt">That's sticking in there.</q>
  <q class="ben">Sorry!</q>
  <q class="matt">I don't believe what you just said, but I want people to like you less. Because there's already been people requesting that you take Koby's place on the podcast.</q>
  <q class="ben">For good reason. What am I not doing right now?</q>
  <q class="matt">Not texting?</q>
  <q class="ben">Or?</q>
  <q class="matt">Going to the bathroom in the middle of the show?</q>
  <q class="ben">You got it!</q>

Ben is worried about {% work "The Hobbit" %} becoming a trilogy <q class="ben inline">It could be a big mess.</q>

  <span class="quote-context is-size-6">Matt learns the term "speculative fiction" and suggests they rename the podcast "The Speculative-Fiction Christian".</span>
  <q class="ben">"The Spec-Fiction Christian" sounds like a name Koby would come up with: just awkward and weird and so long you have room for a bathroom break in it.</q>

  <span class="quote-context is-size-6">What are the origins of Satan?</span>
  <q class="matt">I want to come back to this topic. Maybe now is not the right time. Let's study this a little.</q>
  <q class="ben">OK. A Satan episode.</q>
  <q class="matt">Nice.</q>
  <q class="ben">That'll be fun.</q>
  <q class="matt">Good.</q>
  <q class="ben">Maybe episode 666.</q>
  <q class="matt">Oh, can we wait that long? We're only on episode 80. How about 86?</q>
  <q class="ben">What if we promise to do it right after our Alan Moore show?</q>

  <q class="matt">One of my next ones is somebody who we both know. One of my runners up for visionary was God.</q>
  <q class="ben">Oh. Yeah. *laughter* You gave God a runner up? That's like a backhanded compliment. 'Here, God! Have a consolation prize! I haven't read anything by Isaac Asimov but he's better than you!'</q>

  <q class="matt">But, I'm just going to give him a shout-out, because if I gave God a shout-out, of course Kurt Vonnegut needs one.</q>

  <span class="quote-context is-size-6">Matt's mom suggested Arthur C. Clarke as a sci-fi visionary.</span>
  <q class="matt">I haven't seen Space Odyssey, 2001.</q>
  <q class="ben">I only watched part of it.</q>
  <q class="matt">Not good, or it was OK?</q>
  <q class="ben">I got bored, cuz the first 30 minutes is just monkeys dancing around.</q>
  <q class="matt">Hmm, interesting. I'll have to check that out.</q>
  <q class="ben">Like I'm not even kidding! The movie starts with 30 minutes of monkeys!</q>
