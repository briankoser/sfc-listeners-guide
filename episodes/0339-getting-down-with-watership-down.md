Ben says baby squirrels are just called "baby squirrels". 
{% arc %}I think they're called "kits".{% endarc %}



# Main Topic
Ben recommends the audiobook for {% work "Watership Down" %}. It originated as stories Richard Adams told his children.

Some books are best read out loud. Another example is Neil Gaiman's books.

It's based on {% work "The Aeneid" %} and partly on {% work "The Odyssey" %}.

Contrasts the mundane and the heroic

Non-Tolkien fantasy

Why did Homer have such a large impact on Western civilization?

Virgil connected the powerful myth of Homer to Rome's founding in {% work "The Aeneid" %}.

{% work "The Iliad" %} and {% work "The Odyssey" %} are 24 books long. {% work "The Aeneid" %} is 12 books long. Ben thinks Tolkien wrote {% work "The Lord of the Rings" %} as 6 books as a continuation of the pattern.
