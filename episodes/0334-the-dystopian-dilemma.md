Why are dystopian and post-apocalyptic fiction so popular?

Dan Carlin's Hardcore History inspired this episode. Matt started listening to the podcast as show prep.

History is a factor in the development of fiction.

Post-Cold war, the popularity of post-apocalyptic fiction is probably due more to wish fulfillment than to a working out of shared social fears.
