  <q class="matt">I don't know if people know this, but I don't drink alcohol, and Ben is basically a huge drunk most days.</q>
</div>

Ben's favorite beer is Guinness.

Why do so many Christians not drink?
{% arc %}It's pretty easy to read verses like Proverbs 23:31 (do not look at red wine) and Ephesians 5:18 (do not get drunk with wine) and believe it's wrong. That's how I was always taught, although I personally now think drinking is OK.{% endarc %}



# Main Topic
Ben is going to restart the {% work "Game of Thrones" %} video reviews.

  <span class="quote-context is-size-6">Matt wants to record 100 episodes in Season 3.</span>
  <q class="ben">I can't record two a week, so think of how much Koby you're going to have to have in there. Bad idea.</q>
</div>

Matt wants to do "some sort of {% work "X-Files" %} retrospective". {% arc %}Don't do it!{% endarc %}


Matt thinks {% work "Breaking Bad" %} might be his favorite show ever.
