  <q class="matt">I don't know if people know this, but I don't drink alcohol, and Ben is basically a huge drunk most days.</q>
</div>

Ben's favorite beer is Guinness.

Why do so many Christians not drink?
<q class="archivist inline">It's pretty easy to read verses like Proverbs 23:31 (do not look at red wine) and Ephesians 5:18 (do not get drunk with wine) and believe it's wrong. That's how I was always taught, although I personally now think drinking is OK.</q>



# Main Topic
Ben is going to restart the <i class="work-title">Game of Thrones</i> video reviews.

  <span class="quote-context is-size-6">Matt wants to record 100 episodes in Season 3.</span>
  <q class="ben">I can't record two a week, so think of how much Koby you're going to have to have in there. Bad idea.</q>
</div>

Matt wants to do "some sort of <i class="work-title">X-Files</i> retrospective". <q class="archivist inline">Don't do it!</q>


Matt thinks <i class="work-title">Breaking Bad</i> might be his favorite show ever.
