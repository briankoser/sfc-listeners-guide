recommendation: yes

Ben's favorite beer is Guinness.

Why do so many Christians not drink?
<q class="archivist inline">It's pretty easy to read verses like Proverbs 23:31 (Do not look at wine when it is red) and Ephesians 5:18 (do not get drunk with wine) and believe it's wrong. That's how I was always taught, although I personally now think it's OK.</q>



# Main Topic
Ben is going to restart the <i class="work-title">Game of Thrones</i> video reviews.

Matt wants to do "some sort of <i class="work-title">X-Files</i> retrospective".

Matt thinks <i class="work-title">Breaking Bad</i> might be his favorite show ever.
