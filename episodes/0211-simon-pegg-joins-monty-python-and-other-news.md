Ben and Matt are still upset about the 1998 NFC championship where Atlanta beat Minnesota. <q class="archivist inline">My second earliest football memory.

  <q class="matt">Well, we don't know that, we haven't seen the movie.</q>
  <q class="ben">Sure we know that, because that's what the modus operandi is.</q>

  <q class="matt">I am against disabilities, not against people with disabilities.</q>
  <q class="ben">Don't you think people with disabilities should be able to control their computers?</q>
  <q class="matt">I do.</q>
