Doug from Atlanta is in Minneapolis for business. 

Ben and Matt are still upset about the 1998 NFC championship where Atlanta beat Minnesota. {% arc %}My second earliest football memory. The Vikings were my second-favorite team that year, with ex-Eagles Randall Cunningham and Cris Carter, plus the most exciting rookie of all time, Randy Moss.{% endarc %}

They chat with Doug for 36 minutes and have him vote for the end of year awards live.
