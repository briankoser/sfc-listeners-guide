# Opening
Matt listened to the last episode twice after recording

Brandon Gibbs designed a new logo (the first logo had a sketch of Admiral Akbar; the new one features the alien that will be named Theo)

Naming competition for the alien

Matt said the newspaper seller and boy reading comics in <i class="work-title">Watchmen</i> are named Bernard. Ben wants all the listeners to write in and say Matt is wrong. <q class="archivist inline">Actually Matt is right</q> 

SFC is doing another readalong
