# Theories 

Conspiracy theories about Stanley Kubrick's death 

He died 4 days after screening the final cut off Eyes Wide Shut.

Kubrick's attention to detail and genius make these more plausible. 

Another example: the middle word of The Divine Comedy is "love".

## The Saturn Death Cult / Illuminati

## Anti-Illuminati
Ben's evidence against Stanley Kubrick being in the Illuminati: he didn't like to travel, so he wouldn't have wanted to go to the Satanic rituals.

## The CIA

## Scientoligists

## Ben's theory
Kubrick wanted a bad performance from Shelley Duvall in {% work "The Shining" %} to help the audience sympathize with Jack.
