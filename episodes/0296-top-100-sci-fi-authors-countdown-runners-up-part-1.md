category: countdowns
series: authors-countdown-2014
hosts:
  - Ben
  - Matt

odd_opening: Matt does the intro three times to demonstrate how he does it in time with the music. 
quotes:
  - time: "7:20"
    lines:
      - m: Instantly, even with the first name, terror has struck me. Because I'm realizing, this conversation is gonna be so one-sided.
      - b: It'll be good.
      - m: I'll be good color commentary for you. So there might just be a lot of Ben reading lists and commenting, and me saying, 'Sounds like a nice guy.'

recommendation: yes
recommendation_reason: The start of an amazing countdown
