    lines:
      - m: I love his costume, I love the character--
      - b: Wait. There's no way that you as an adult love this costume. This costume is ridiculous.
      - m: I can't tell the difference anymore.
  - time: "16:25"
    context: Ben wouldn't time travel before indoor plumbing and air conditioning
    lines:
      - b: If you go back in time...I'm sorry, but like 1980 is the farthest back I want to go.
      - m: You know they had indoor plumbing in the '70s, right?
