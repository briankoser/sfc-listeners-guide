Matt's bedtime is 10 pm. Ben starts watching a movie at 10 pm.

Allan "Gango" Reini is the first guest to join.

30 minutes into the episode (but only 5 minutes late), the technical details are settled and we hear the first guests, the Reinis. They immediately go on mute.

CJ gets on video but not audio. He communicates with hand signals.

Brian and Melissa can speak, but can't hear.

CJ can now speak, on a 10-second delay.

Someone's baby is crying in the background. {% arc %}Ooh, probably ours.{% endarc %}

40 minutes in, Brian and Melissa are working completely fine. Nobody else.
