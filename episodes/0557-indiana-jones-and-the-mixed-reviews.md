Both hosts agree the Indiana Jones franchise has one great film, one fun film, and two obnoxious films.

Ben pronounces Shia LaBeouf as "Shia LaBoof".

{% quotes podcast_file_url, quotes[0] %}

Spielberg is Jewish, and directs the film that ends with the Hebrew God melting Nazis.

Belloq as Indy's Jungian shadow self.

Matt notices that if it's a story about the Jews, the defeat of serpents and death ties in to Genesis.
