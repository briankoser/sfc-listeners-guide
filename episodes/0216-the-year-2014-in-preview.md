  <q class="matt">This one's gotta be a five. {% work "Interstellar" %} is a five.</q>
  <q class="koby">I hope you're both disappointed. I don't hope that, that's mean. I hope that you're pleasantly surprised.</q>
  <q class="ben">How can we be pleasantly surprised if we're expecting it to be a five?</q>
  <q class="koby">You could get a six out of five.</q>

  <q class="koby">I honestly never liked the Muppets, so—</q>
  <q class="ben">So wait, can we keep a list here? Things Koby doesn't like: {% work "Lord of the Rings" %}, {% work "Breaking Bad" %}, The Muppets—</q>
  <q class="matt">{% work "LOST" %}</q>
  <q class="ben">{% work "Doctor Who" %}, {% work "LOST" %}, and Christopher Nolan.</q>

  <q class="matt">That's a good idea that we fixed in 2013: putting the listener feedback at the end of the news.</q>
  <q class="ben">Yeah.</q>
  <q class="matt">Cuz having listener feedback as its own episode, not a winning idea.</q>
  <q class="ben">Not a winning idea.</q>
