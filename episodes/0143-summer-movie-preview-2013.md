  <span class="quote-context is-size-6">Matt says it's cool that Will Smith is getting his son acting jobs, even in bad movies like <i class="work-title">After Earth</i>.</span>
  <q class="matt">Will Smith: way to be a father.</q>
  <q class="ben">Yeah. Good job.</q>
  <q class="matt">It's useful—you know, for people like myself that grew up without a father.</q>
  <q class="ben">Oh.</q>
  <q class="matt">It's nice to think about if my father was Will Smith—</q>
  <q class="ben">This took a painful turn.</q>
  <q class="matt">—who knows what could have happened.</q>
  <q class="ben">Yeah.</q>
  <q class="matt">Maybe I wouldn't be on this crappy podcast.</q>

Ben is for <i class="work-title">The Wolverine</i>. Matt is against it and says it's a rental. 

Christopher Lee is Ben's favorite actor.

Matt refuses to say the title of the movie <i class="work-title">Kickass 2</i>.
