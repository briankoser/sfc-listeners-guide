prophecy:
  - host: Ben
    prediction: Unlikely that Daredevil will have a big screen comeback
    veracity: true
    comments: Although he will have a Netflix series that both hosts will enjoy.
  - host: Matt
    prediction: DC and WB will continue to make Batman movies in the Nolan-verse
    veracity: false
  - host: Ben
    prediction: Nolan will continue as executive producer and make more movies in the Nolan-verse
    veracity: false
    comments: "Half correct: Nolan was the executive producer for <i class='work-title'>Batman v Superman</i> and <i class='work-title'>Justice League</i>"
  - host: Ben
    prediction: "If <i class='work-title'>Thor</i>, <i class='work-title'>Captain America</i>, and <i class='work-title'>Green Lantern</i> get negative or lukewarm responses it will bring on another period of superhero fatigue."
    veracity: true
    comments: "<i class='work-title'>Thor</i> and <i class='work-title'>Captain America</i> got generally positive responses, but I will count this as true because it was true for Ben personally."
  - host: Ben
    prediction: The superhero genre has solid 4 or 5 years, then another major franchise will need to emerge.
    veracity: false
    comments: As of 2018, Marvel is still the premier superhero franchise and has shown no signs of slowing down.
  - host: Matt
    prediction: "Superheroes will not bring us through postmodernism; <i class='work-title'>Watchmen</i> is a good reflection of the culture."
    veracity: true
    comments: Looks like this will be correct
  - host: Ben
    prediction: Postmodernism will break down, due in part to superhero films
    veracity: false
    comments: Has not happened yet, and Ben now wants no more superhero movies, so maybe was too optimistic.

last_listen: 2018-01-26
recommendation: no
recommendation_reason: Mostly predictions of which superhero movies will be good.
archivist_note: Both are very optimistic about the superhero film genre, Ben even more so than Matt.

# Main Topic

## Phases of Superhero Movies

1. Early (1978-1997, {% work "Superman" %}-{% work "Batman and Robin" %})
2. Rennaisance (2000-2005, includes X-Men 1-2, Spider-Man 1-2, {% work "Batman Begins" %})
3. Fatigue (2005-2008, includes {% work "Ghost Rider" %}, {% work "Electra" %}, {% work "Punisher" %}, {% work "Fantastic Four" %}, {% work "Superman Returns" %}, {% work "X-Men 3" %}, {% work "Wolverine" %}, {% work "Spider-Man 3" %})
4. Rejuvenation (2008-, {% work "The Dark Knight" %}, {% work "Iron Man" %})

## Factors to determine the future of the superhero genre

1. Will {% work "The Avengers" %} succeed?
2. What happens to Batman post-Nolan?
3. Will {% work "X-Men: First Class" %} be a successful spinoff?
4. Will {% work "The Amazing Spider-Man" %} be a successful reboot?
5. Can lesser-known characters like {% work "Thor" %}, {% work "Captain America" %}, and {% work "Green Lantern" %} be successful? 

{% countdown countdowns.predictions %}

Hopefully superhero movies will help bring us through postmodernism.

The genre is unique because it's currently the only one that's mythological.

Will directors and studios see the success of {% work "The Dark Knight" %} as caused by it's dark and gritty feel or because it had things deep and objective to say? {% arc %}Sorry guys, they took dark and gritty{% endarc %}
