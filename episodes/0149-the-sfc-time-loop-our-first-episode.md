recommendation: yes
recommendation_reason: Lays a good foundation for where Ben and Matt were with their interests when they started the show.
archivist_note: I finally realized that Matt named the first episode "Pilot" not because it's a pilot episode, but because the first episode of LOST is titled "Pilot". ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

# Opening

Unedited because there's only 6 minutes of news

Ben says he was less negative but also less right.



# Time Loop

Ben reveals that they have a lifetime contract for the show.

The LOST Report addicted Ben to podcasting.

<div class="quote">
  {% timeLink podcast_file_url, '6:18' %}
  <q class="ben">Even before I got into ministry, I am a lifelong nerd and completely unapologetic about it.</q>
  <q class="matt">I thought you were going to say, 'lifelong lover of Christ'.</q>
  <q class="ben">...That too.</q>
</div>

The show won't be strictly sci-fi, it will include all of genre fiction and related topics.

Ben wants to do a {% work "Twilight" %} episode (<q class="ben inline">It's cool that {% work "Twilight" %} is bringing people into geek culture.</q>)

They will have guest hosts over Skype to discuss topics they're not knowledgeable in.

They will report news, review movies and TV shows, and discuss philosophy and theology.

<div class="quote">
  {% timeLink podcast_file_url, '11:44' %}
  <q class="matt">I was surprised by how many people were offended by me saying that Jesus might have been a zombie.</q>
</div>

R2-D2 is the transition sound for everything.

Ben did only sci-fi, no fantasy <q class="archivist inline">{% work "The Wheel of Time" %} isn't fantasy?</q>

Matt has never heard of {% work "The Wheel of Time" %}.

Ben thinks Fringe is a 4-5 season show. 

Matt said it would be crazy to buy comic books monthly.

Ben wishes Spider-Man were in the Avengers movies.

Matt says he loves {% work "Attack of the Clones" %} (although he later retracts the statement) 

Ben makes the point that while {% work "LOST" %} usually ended episodes on a mystery moment, {% work "Buffy" %} always ended on a character moment.
