      - m: I'm guessing God had a good idea this was going to work out because there was a lot riding on Paul.

# Time Loop

Open Theism

Would it have been better for God to make all the choices for us?

Would you give up your free will if it meant everyone would be saved?

Is predestination unjust?

DeBonism "invented" (God elects, and those elect have the responsibility to make more elect)
