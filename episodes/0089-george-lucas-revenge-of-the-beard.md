  <span class="quote-context is-size-6">Matt talks about his feelings when he heard the news</span>
  <q class="matt">I was excited, I was nervous, I didn't know what to feel exactly at first. But I think...I think I feel that there's some positivity that could come out of this.</q>
  <q class="ben">Sounds like your wedding night.</q>
  <q class="matt">Say it again, what?</q>
  <q class="ben">Sounds like your wedding night.</q>
  <q class="matt">Like, you're nervous--</q>
  <q class="ben">'I was nervous, I was excited, I didn't know what to expect.'</q>
  <q class="matt">Unfortunately, I'm unmarried, so I don't quite understand that reference.</q>

  <span class="quote-context is-size-6">Ben tells about when he found out the news</span>
  <q class="ben">So then I'm done at the library, and I'm walking to a meeting with one of my professors, and I call up my friend on the phone, and he says--</q>
  <q class="matt">Me?</q>
  <q class="ben">No.</q>
  <q class="matt">Oh.</q>
  <q class="ben">No. We didn't talk on Tuesday.</q>
  <q class="matt">A different friend?</q>

  <q class="matt">How much are pope robes going for these days on Craigslist?</q>
  <q class="ben">Oh man, probably a lot.</q>
  <q class="matt">Would you, if you were gonna to buy a pope robe, would you look to Craigslist or eBay?</q>
  <q class="ben">I like eBay.</q>
  <q class="matt">Yeah, higher quality there. PayPal.</q>

  <span class="quote-context is-size-6">Matt asks Ben how much he'd like to be Pope, on a scale from 1-5.</span>
  <q class="ben">For a non-serious answer, we'll give it a 3.7.</q>
  <q class="matt">OK. Thank you. I will give it like a 2, because I think it would be cool, but not so cool that I want to be Catholic. Oooh!</q>
  <q class="ben">Oooh!</q>
  <q class="matt">Sorry.</q>
  <q class="ben">Geez, what a dick. *laughs* You can leave that in.</q>
  <q class="matt">OK, I'm keeping that in. I'm sorry folks that had to hear Ben say that. Ever since you became a Catholic, you've sworn so much more. I'm not saying that that was a swear word, but you've been way more inappropriate on the show.</q>
  <q class="ben">Well, I think it's because, not so much being a Catholic but not being a pastor anymore. My motivation to be a good example has dwindled.</q>
  <q class="matt">Just for the record, I would usually edit that out, but I just don't want to. It's super time-consuming to edit out everything Ben says. You don't know. You don't know what I do: every single week I have to edit out Ben. And I just don't want to.</q>
  <q class="ben">It's true. I feel a little bad about it but not very bad. </q>

  <q class="ben">I bet you that there will be some type of Skywalker character.</q>
  <q class="matt">I think there has to be, right?</q>
  <q class="ben">Yeah.</q>
  <q class="matt">So who's kid is it gonna be? Luke's or Leia's?</q>
  <q class="ben">Maybe a little bit of both. Star Wars: The Next Generation. I don't mean like--</q>
  <q class="matt">My face just dropped.</q>
  <q class="ben">Now that was unintentional.</q>
  <q class="matt">You don't mean their children. Like, together. OK.</q>
  <q class="ben">No, no.</q>
  <q class="matt">So you think like Han and Leia's child, and then also Luke's child with a different woman other than his sister.</q>
  <q class="ben">Yes.</q>
  <q class="matt">OK. That's what you meant.</q>
  <q class="ben">That's what I meant.</q>

  <q class="ben">I hope they don't do something like where Han Solo has his own movie, and Chewbacca has his own movie...</q>
  <q class="matt">That would be stupid.</q>

George Lucas had a treatment for Episodes 7-9 <q class="archivist inline">We'll find out what it was in № 662.</q>

Ben says <i class="work-title">The Avengers</i> is the worst thing Joss Whedon has done.

Ben doesn't like Disney buying <i class="work-title">Star Wars</i> because:
- It's Lucas's story
- People always want more, and it's a problem with the culture 

Matt asks the listeners to vote in the Podcast Awards. Or send money through the website.

Ben would prefer a reboot than a continuation of the existing <i class="work-title">Star Wars</i> story.
