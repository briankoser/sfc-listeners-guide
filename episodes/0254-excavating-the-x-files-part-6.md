  <q class="ben">That guy had a killer moustache.</q>
  <q class="matt">Oh, yeah that guy was awesome. Yeah, I kind of like his no-nonsense attitude, kind of laissez-faire.</q>
  <q class="ben">Don't you kind of wish the moustache would come back into fashion?</q>
  <q class="matt">Well, I mean, look at you with it. I mean, facial hair is big.</q>
  <q class="ben">No no no no no no no no, not the full beard. I'm talking just the moustache.</q>
  <q class="matt">You know, I'm not—I don't necessarily, I'm not missing it, I guess. But it's fine. If you have a moustache out there, feel proud.</q>
  <q class="ben">Have you ever thought of growing a moustache?</q>
  <q class="matt">I…don't think I can. Facial hair hasn't ever been my specialty.</q>

  <q class="ben">I believe in you. I think that if you actually gave it a try for a month or so, you could get a solid ’stache.</q>
  <q class="matt">You know, if I had a job where I didn't have to look professional, I would let my facial hair grow out a little bit just to give it a shot.</q>
  <q class="ben">Yeah. You really should.</q>
  <q class="matt">I just don't have that capacity right now.</q>
  <q class="ben">Well, you know, just forget your job. Just let them deal with it for a month or so.</q>
  <q class="matt">Good advice from Ben De Bono! That's a good topic for a future episode.</q>

Ben says the standalone episodes are the best and worst episodes; the mythology episodes are just a mess.

Ben is sad that the rewatch is making him like the show less.

  <q class="matt">There's only one episode left—nope, two episodes left in Season 4 that are worth discussing. And then…yep, and then quite a bit more. One two three four five six seven…twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen, seventeen, eighteen—yeah we have…oh boy. Oh boy, Ben. We have a lot more. We have a lot more to do. We have over twenty more episodes to watch, if not thirty.</q>
