# Opening
Matt says they could have gone to Comic Con for his bachelor party. Ben no longer wants to go because of the crowds. If they did go, he thinks they should cosplay as each other. 



# Main Topic
## Comic Books
Forget Continuity
- For example, restart continuity every 10 years
- Each creative team starts a new continuity 

Cap the number of monthly titles a character appears in

Reduce the number of monthly titles

Death should stick

Take big risks

Let creators make the story decisions instead of marketing and corporate

Make room for existing characters

Tell shorter, self contained stories 
- Reduce company wide events



## Comic Book Movies

Cut budgets in half

Don't write for the sequel
<ul>
  <li><i class="work-title">Guardians of the Galaxy</i> might be the best movie of Phase 2 because it will be self-contained.</li>
</ul>

Cut runtime

When you try to please everyone, you please no one

Stop being spoiler-phobic

Have goals beyond making money


## Heavy Hitters
