  <span class="quote-context is-size-6">Matt asks Daniel and Koby if they remember last year's Listener Appreciation Jubilee.</span>
  <q class="koby">Wait, didn't I win something last year?</q>
  <q class="daniel">Oh, dude.</q>
  <q class="matt">Yeah, you won 'Cohost of the Year', or no, it was 'Guest Host of the Year' I think.</q>
  <q class="daniel">Based solely on going to the bathroom.</q>
  <q class="koby">OK, that's awesome though. Immortalized.</q>
</div>

Matt asks podcasters to send in promos for their shows for Episode 100.

  <span class="quote-context is-size-6">Matt lists the award categories for the Jubilee</span>
  <q class="matt">'Worst Episode of the Year'. Do you know which one won? Was that yours too?</q>
  <q class="koby">Oh my gosh.</q>
  <q class="matt">I think it might have been, Koby. The one about, you know, Bigfoot and Sasquatch.</q>
  <q class="koby">Why would that have been the worst?</q>
  <q class="matt">Weeell...you were on it.</q>

  <q class="matt">Both Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher have said that they definitely want to be in Episode VII.</q>
  <q class="koby">Yay! Carrie Fisher, 60-year-old in a bikini.</q>
  <q class="matt">Koby, what is wrong with you? They're probably not going to put her in that again.</q>
  <q class="koby">What else...she didn't wear anything else!</q>
  <q class="matt">I don't think...how recently have you seen these movies?</q>
  <q class="koby">Yesterday.</q>

# Closing
Matt says the Season 1 Highlight Reel took a long time to put together and he won't be doing it this year. But he invites the listeners to make a Season 2 highlight reel and send it in.
