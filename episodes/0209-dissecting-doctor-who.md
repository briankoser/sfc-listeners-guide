Matt caught up on the show by the 50th Anniversary {% arc %}Crazy. But he did give the Matt Anderson Guarantee.{% endarc %}

Ben's main criticism is that it's not a deep show; there's nothing that sticks with you.

Ben said they'll know they arrived when the SFC has more episodes than {% work "Doctor Who" %}. 
{% arc %}This happened when Episode 862 was released on December 16, 2020.{% endarc %}
