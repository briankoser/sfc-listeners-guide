recommendation: yes
recommendation_reason: Good discussion of themes and interpretations from Aronofsky's Noah
archivist_note: Another interesting interpretation I've read is that <a href="http://drbrianmattson.com/journal/2014/3/31/sympathy-for-the-devil">it's based on the Kabbalah Noah story</a> rather than the Bible's.

  <q class="ben">We survived somehow. God didn't zap us with lightning on our way out of the theatre.</q>

Someone called Ben an atheist and a fake Christian for liking the movie.

A lot of Christians had hysterical reactions to the movie.

# Lies Christians are telling about the movie
1. Noah teaches God didn't create the world. 
2. Noah worships Satan. 
3. The movie is about global warming. 
4. There is no mention of God. 
5. The movie is pro-abortion. 
6. The movie promotes the worship of the environment. 
7. Noah is portrayed as a vegetarian inaccurately. 
8. The movie is about overpopulation.

# Contradictions from the movie to the Bible 
1. Lamech dies sooner
2. The Nephilim don't have sex with human women
3. Only one of Noah's sons is married
4. Birds are sent from the ark differently
5. God speaks through visions
6. Noah doesn't curse Ham 
7. Naked Noah is before the covenant

Daren Aronofsky is Jewish.

2. God is called Creator: "Elohim" is the word in Genesis and means "Creator God"
3. Lamech
4. Shem, Ham, and Japheth

6. God regrets humanity
7. The earth is corrupt
8. The ark dimensions
