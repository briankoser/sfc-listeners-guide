  <span class="quote-context is-size-6">Matt asks Ben to tell about how he started studying masculinity</span>
  <q class="ben">We have to go back to the time of Protestant Ben here. So, Protestant Ben, I was 'sociate pastor at Epic Life Church.</q>
  <q class="matt">For some reason, I thought you were going to say a 'sociopath'.</q>
</div>

Why does masculinity seem endangered in our culture? 

Post-enlightenment western culture is the first culture in history without formalized initiation rites. 

Calling out, breaking down, exposing weak points, rebuilding with certain values 

<div class="quote">
  {% timeLink {url:podcast_file_url, t:'11:00'} %}
  <q data-name="Eric">Would you say you are essentially a 'man consultant'? Like a consultant on manliness?</q>
  <q class="ben">A mansultant? I could be a mansultant.</q>
  <q data-name="Brad">I could use some mansulting.</q>
  <q class="ben">Yes.</q>
  <q class="matt">What does that mean, Brad?</q>
  <q data-name="Brad">I don't know.</q>
</div>

<div class="quote">
  {% timeLink {url:podcast_file_url, t:'13:01'} %}
  <q data-name="Brad">There's a huge fat squirrel right outside your window, and I really want to get it.</q>
  <q class="matt">Well, this is the man-isode.</q>
  <q class="ben">Oh, I love—</q>
  <q data-name="Eric">Prove your manliness. Go get it.</q>
  <q class="matt">Go get it.</q>
  <q class="ben">Catch it with your bare hands and we'll all eat it here. Raw.</q>
  <q data-name="Brad">Do you have any weapons?</q>
  <q class="matt">Yeah, man I got—</q>
  <q class="ben">This is Matt Anderson—</q>
  <q data-name="Brad">Do you have a ninja star?</q>
  <q class="matt">No, I actually don't have that yet. I ordered one for Christmas.</q>
  <q data-name="Eric">What about that pile of rocks there with all of those names on it, in that jar?</q>
  <q class="matt">Oh, that's a wedding thing that we got there.</q>
  <q data-name="Eric">Perfect.</q>
  <q class="ben">Have you read all those?</q>
  <q class="matt">No, I haven't.</q>
  <q class="ben">Cuz I wrote 'Ben is Right' on mine.</q>
  <q class="matt">You did not. Did you really?</q>
  <q class="ben">Yes I did.</q>
  <q class="matt">So just to give my credentials then: through Ben's research, I had also learned a lot about masculinity, which didn't do me any good because I wasn't allowed to do the ministry with him.</q>
  <q class="ben">Gosh, are you gonna to let this go, man? I apologized like two years ago!</q>
</div>

<div class="quote">

  <q class="matt">Hey, and speaking of men, at this table today are two of my groomsmen, and then Brad.</q>
</div>

What traits are manly? 

{% countdown countdowns.sciFi %}

Ben says movie Aragorn is a wimp because he doesn't want to be king. {% arc %}I guess they tried to give him a hero's journey and this was his 'refusal of the call'.{% endarc %}

<div class="quote">
  {% timeLink {url:podcast_file_url, t:'24:15'} %}
  <span class="quote-context is-size-6">Book Aragorn doesn't waffle about being king</span>
  <q class="ben">He knows who he's supposed to be, and he goes and be's it.</q>
  <q class="matt">Good.</q>
  <q data-name="Brad">'Goes and be's it?'</q>
  <q class="ben">Goes and be's it!</q>
  <q data-name="Eric">Thank you English-major Ben.</q>
  <q class="ben">I am an English major actually!</q>
  <q data-name="Eric">We are really behind the rest of the world in our educational system.</q>
</div>

One male archetype is the king, either noble or tyrant. 

Authentic and godly masculinity is neither suppressed nor uncontrolled

Brad uses the term "buttkickability" to mean "able to kick butt". Ben thinks it should be "buttkickableness". {% arc %}I propose "buttkickery"{% endarc %}

Matt is the only one in the room without a beard.
