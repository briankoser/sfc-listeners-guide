  <span class="quote-context is-size-6">Matt compared his childhood fandom of wrestling to his later LOST obsession.</span>
  <q class="matt">Now it's more of like, I'll watch it, and I don't follow it from week to week, but Koby catches me up once a month. It's kind of our fun time together. It's our, you know...I was going to say 'private time' but I was like, that's not right. And 'personal time' wouldn't be right. It's like our 'special time together', does that sound right?</q>
  <q class="ben">No, none of these are sounding right. But keep going.</q>
  <q class="matt">Yeah I mean, what kind of adjective would you use--like this is our time together, podcasting.</q>
  <q class="ben">'Man time'?</q>
  <q class="matt">Like you and I have this podcasting. Koby and I have monthly wrestling. Wait.</q>
