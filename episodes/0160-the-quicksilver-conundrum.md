Quicksilver will be in both Marvel and Fox movies

Ben thinks it will confuse people. <q class="archivist inline">Does this really confuse people? It would have to be people that: A. Are not hardcore comic or movie fans, so they're not following news or iMDB credits; B. See both movies; C. Realize that the character in both movies is supposed to be the same, instead of just another fast guy; D. Have never seen a movie series like James Bond, and so are not familiar with the concept of a character being played by multiple actors.</q>

Ben says the superhero genre is dead.
