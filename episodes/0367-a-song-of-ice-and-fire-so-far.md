Differences between the books and show

What did Brienne yell when she was being hanged?

Who is Cold Hands? GRRM said it isn't Benjen Stark.

Ben thinks Jon will warg into Ghost as he dies in the books, but will be resurrected by Melisandre in the show.

Both think Rickon will be important in the story. Ben thinks he will be the Lord of Winterfell. Matt thinks Bran.

What is the purpose of the Faceless Men?

Other theories:
- Varys and Ilyrio conspiracy 
- Young Griff
- Ser Robert Strong is The Mountain re-animated
- Missandei is a Faceless Man
- Bran will become the next Night's King

Ben says the real conflict is Varys vs Littlefinger.

- What does the comet signify?
- Will Bran change the past?
- Who is Azor Ahai?

Would we do child sacrifice if it worked? The atomic bomb killed thousands of children.

The Seven are modeled after medieval Christianity.
