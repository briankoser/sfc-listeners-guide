# Opening
Ben appears for the first time in seven months. 

Ben forgets to say, "We are back!"

Ben apologizes for The History of Christianity, <q class="ben inline">the worst podcasts in the history of podcasting</q>.

Ben is now Executive Pastor at Epic Life. 

Ben is planning to get another masters degree (ThM) to prepare for a doctoral degree.

Matt now rates <i class="work-title">The Avengers</i> at 5 stars. Ben rates it 4 stars. 

Ben is tired of mediocre superhero movies.

  <span class="quote-context is-size-6">Ben doesn't like going to theatres.</span>
  <q class="ben">Like for example, we took our kids to go see <i class="work-title">Brave</i> earlier this week. $26! Just for the tickets! We could have bought the stupid DVD for that much.</q>
  <q class="matt">See man? This is why it's way better to be single and childless!</q>
  <q class="ben">I hear ya.</q>
  <q class="matt">Because I saw <i class="work-title">Brave</i> for a mere $5.</q>
</div>

Ben is upset about the bare butts in <i class="work-title">Brave</i>.

Matt suggests leaving The Incredible Hulk as a supporting character in the movies <q class="archivist inline">They did</q>

  <span class="quote-context is-size-6"></span>
  <q class="matt">So Joss Whedon, <i class="work-title">Cabin in the Woods</i>, you asked me to see it with you, I said 'yes', and then you saw it with somebody else.</q>
  <q class="ben">No, you said, 'No, cuz I'm worried that I'll be scared and wet myself like a little sissy because of how terrifying it is.'</q>
  <q class="matt">This is a paraphrase.</q>
  <q class="ben">A rough paraphrase.</q>

  <span class="quote-context is-size-6">The hosts discuss <i class="work-title">Prometheus</i></span>
  <q class="matt">As with the former Alien movies, there were some intense, horrific images in this one.</q>
  <q class="ben">Did you have to shut your eyes?</q>
  <q class="matt">Yeah. I'm not ashamed to admit that I shut my eyes during things.</q>
  <q class="ben">I would be a little ashamed to admit it.</q>

  <q class="ben">This is right up your alley with 'Jesus is a zombie': Jesus is an alien, according to the <i class="work-title">Prometheus</i> franchise.</q>
</div>

Everyone is now doing short TV seasons, like Ben suggested.
