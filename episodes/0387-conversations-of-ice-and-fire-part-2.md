Matt thinks he found two more ASOIAF conversation clips. He actually found one more clip.

The first clip is 1 minute, 20 seconds. Matt says he's listening to {% work "A Dance with Dragons" %} and wants to do an episode when it's finished.

The second clip was already included in {% episodeLink 368 %}.
