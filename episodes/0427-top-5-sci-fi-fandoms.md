Matt guested on Geekually Yoked in January 2014.

{% countdown countdowns.fandoms %}

Andrew Reeves (former guest on Geekually Yoked) shared an idea he read from some 14th-century Franciscan monks: anything that a human can imagine is also in the mind of God, and therefore has a certain amount of reality to it.

Leeman recommends starting the Discworld series with {% work "Mort" %}.

Rachel recommends Dorothy Sayers. Start with her book {% work "Letters to a Diminished Church" %}.
