# Opening
Stan Lee Quote of the Week: Ben mentioned Joel Osteen during his last sermon <q class="archivist inline">Yes, not Stan Lee or a quote</q> 



# News
The Scarlet Spider is one of Matt's top 5 superheroes.

<div class="quote">
  <q class="ben">Take that, terrorists!</q>
</div> 

Ben says "Lindelhof" but Matt doesn't call him on it.

<div class="quote">
  <span class="quote-context is-size-6">Mark Hamill said Arkham City is the last time he'll voice the Joker.</span>
  <q class="matt">At least it's not Kevin Conroy. If we lost him as the voice of Batman...that would be the worst.</q>
  <q class="archivist inline">The next game in the series, Arkham Origins, had different voice actors for Batman and Joker. The final entry, Arkham Knight, featured both Conroy and Hamill.</q>
</div>



# Main Topic
Is art subjective? 

Is torture ever OK?

<div class="quote">
  <q class="ben">If I was in a scenario like that, it's difficult to say that I wouldn't use whatever option I could to save the lives of countless people.</q>
  <q class="matt">Would you cut off somebody's finger?</q>
  <q class="ben">I said, whatever options available to me.</q>
  <q class="matt">Would you cut off two of their fingers?</q>
  <q class="ben">Maybe even three.</q>
  <q class="matt">Oh my gosh. You're a monster!</q>
</div> 

<div class="quote">
  <q class="matt">On the spot, without thinking it through too much, I'm pro-torture.</q>
</div>

<div class="quote">
  <q class="matt">I mean, I wouldn't torture just to mess with them. It would only be for information extraction. </q>
  <q class="ben">I'm glad we clarified that. 'Matt Anderson: not in favor of recreational torture'.</q>

# Feedback
Dave Johnson reads some of Mark Twain's review of {% work "The Deerslayer" %}. <q class="archivist">Twain's review is hilarious and well-worth reading, but it's not applicable to {% work "LOST" %}.</q>
