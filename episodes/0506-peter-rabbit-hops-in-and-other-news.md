There is a Peter Rabbit movie coming. Ben predicts a Beatrix Potter cinematic universe.

How do you be a man separate from being a husband and a father?

Ben says you need to establish masculinity. Go to church for yourself, not for your wife and family. Have dad's world be separate (but not apart) from mom's world. (For example, an office as "dad's room". Taking the kids when you go to Office Depot.)
