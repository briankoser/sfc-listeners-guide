  <q class="matt">Ben, how do you feel about the Great Commission? Let me start there before I go on to-</q>  
  <q class="ben">Why do you keep asking me how I feel about things like--Jesus, this is his last words to us before he goes to heaven. How do you think I feel about them? Are you pro-Great Commission or anti-Great Commission? Let's take a poll of all Christians and find out how many of them are anti-Great Commission. Let's start with me: I'm pro. How about you, Matt?</q>
  <q class="matt">...Pro.</q>
