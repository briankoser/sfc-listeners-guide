    lines:
      - m: In some ways, I thought about you as I chose. Cuz I had some different options and it was like, which one will make Ben happy?
      - b: Oh, that's very kind. I did not think of you at all while I was doing my list. I'm sorry.
  - time: "20:37"
    context: Matt is going to read Paradise Lost
    lines:
      - m: I predict it's gonna be four stars.
      - b: What?!
      - m: What do you think it's going to be?
      - b: It's a classic! Out of respect alone you should rate it five stars.
      - m: OK, I'll change it.
      - b: You can have two different ratings, maybe. Five stars for respect, four for preference.
      - m: "No, I'll have two ratings: one that I think, and one that Ben wants me to think."
  - time: "24:01"
    lines:
      - m: I love Jesus. 
      - b: What about Jim Caviezel as Jesus?
      - m: I actually really like Jim Caviezel, in general.
      - b: Yeah. I would put him below Jesus though on my list of people.
      - m: Like right below, or...
      - b: No, there's probably a few places between Jesus and Jim Caviezel.

Matt had a dream with the word "anathem", so he's now going to read the book.

Ben picked {% work "Nine Princes in Amber" %} for Matt's list.
