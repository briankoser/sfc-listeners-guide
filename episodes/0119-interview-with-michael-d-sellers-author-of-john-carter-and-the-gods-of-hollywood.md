# Interview

Michael Sellers is an independent filmmaker and Burroughs fan that started following <i class="work-title">John Carter</i> production news. He wrote a blog, then a book.

<i class="work-title">John Carter</i> cost more to make than <i class="work-title">The Avengers</i> but was marketed 20 times less. 

One of the critics' main complaints was that the multiple framing narratives were confusing.

The acquisition of Marvel made <i class="work-title">John Carter</i> less important to Disney as a property to draw boys. 

The acquisition of <i class="work-title">Star Wars</i> made the chance of any future <i class="work-title">John Carter</i> movies from Disney very unlikely.
