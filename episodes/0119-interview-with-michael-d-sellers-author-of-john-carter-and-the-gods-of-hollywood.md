# Interview

Michael Sellers is an independent filmmaker and Burroughs fan that started following {% work "John Carter" %} production news. He wrote a blog, then a book.

{% work "John Carter" %} cost more to make than {% work "The Avengers" %} but was marketed 20 times less. 

One of the critics' main complaints was that the multiple framing narratives were confusing.

The acquisition of Marvel made {% work "John Carter" %} less important to Disney as a property to draw boys. 

The acquisition of {% work "Star Wars" %} made the chance of any future {% work "John Carter" %} movies from Disney very unlikely.
