  <q class="matt">What's going to actually happen (spoiler alert) is Balaam is going to betray him and kill him with his sword. But—</q>
  <q class="ben">Ooh, he puts the sword in the [bleep].</q>

  <q class="matt">But, when his plan falls apart, Ehud is forced to fight the evil king to the death! The gluttonous king is famous for his swordplay. However, Ehud ends up stabbing him in the stomach! In the disgusting conclusion to their battle, Ehud must push the sword in so deeply that King Eglon's fat actually covers the hilt of the sword.</q>
  <q class="ben">That's so cool.</q>
  <q class="matt">Then, pushing it further into his stomach until it is not even visible, Ehud completes the assassination. It's at this point that Eglon loses—this is disgusting—it's at this point that Eglon loses control of his bowels, and begins to defecate mercilessly all over his chamber.</q>
  <q class="ben">What the [bleep]! I can't believe you included that!</q>
