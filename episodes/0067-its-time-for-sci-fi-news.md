  <span class="quote-context is-size-6">Matt explains that the next Transformers movie will be a sequel but not strongly connected to the previous movies.</span>
  <q class="matt">You can go to the fourth having never seen the third, which, I don't think anybody would have never seen the first three.</q>
  <q class="koby">It sucks because Shia LeBeef makes those movies so much better.</q>
  <q class="matt">What?! I have never once heard one person in the entire world ever claim that he made a movie better.</q>
  <q class="daniel">My heart. My heart cries.</q>
  <q class="koby">It's Shia LeBeef.</q>
  <q class="matt">You like him? I don't think you're saying his name right.</q>
  <q class="koby">That's cuz actually his name in French means 'beef'. Huh huh. That's why everyone says 'Shia LeBeef'.</q>
  <q class="matt">That's a weird thing to say.</q>
  <q class="koby">It's not weird. Why is that weird?</q>
  <q class="matt">I don't know.</q>
  <q class="koby">You just don't like beef.</q>
  <q class="matt">Actually that's true: I prefer chicken.</q>
  <q class="koby">See? Told ya.</q>
  <q class="matt">That took an interesting turn.</q>

  <span class="quote-context is-size-6">Daniel says that when you think of superheroes, you think of DC's iconic heroes like Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, and Aquaman.</span>
  <q class="matt">You know who thinks of Aquaman? Fish. And fish can't talk. And fish don't pay to see movies, Daniel.</q>
