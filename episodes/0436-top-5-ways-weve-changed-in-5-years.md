If Matt leaves, Ben will replace him with Ben Adams and Ben Kirkwald.

{% quotes podcast_file_url, quotes[0] %}

It's their five-year anniversary of podcasting.

{% countdown countdowns.changed %}

Ben stopped reading graphic novels because they don't count for his book reading goals.

Matt and Ben are now on [Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/).

"Matt Anderson inflation" is Matt rating movies and books higher than they deserve.

Ben rants about {% work "Dear Zoo" %}.

The Stanley Kubrick Revolution is Ben paying attention to movies instead of half-watching while he worked.

Ben has also started watching the Criterion Collection of films.
