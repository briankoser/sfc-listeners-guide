Jorge Bergoglio becomes the first pope from the Americas (and the first from the Southern Hemisphere), the first Jesuit pope, and the first pope named Francis. He's also the first non-European pope in a millennium.

Matt plans to release the Bible Trivia podcast in the SFC feed but with separate numbering. Possibly they'll spin off more podcasts. 

Matt wants to do SFC-sanctioned top 100 lists. Eventually he wants to do movies and books, but they'll start with TV shows. 

Ben says the listeners can send in as many shows as they like. Matt reins him in and asks for top 20 lists.
