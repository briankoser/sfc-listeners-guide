Ben's number one Star Wars wish will not be fulfilled: Simon Pegg will not be in Star Wars because there are some things he wants to just enjoy as a fan. Matt points out the JJ Abrams said the same thing. {% arc %}<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2488496/fullcredits?ref_=tt_cl_sm#cast">Good call, Matt</a>{% endarc %}

Matt will send a wedding invitation to the listener with the highest donation.

Encouraging Signs: {% work "Under the Dome" %} only got renewed for 13 episodes

What the Frodo: Colin Ferguson said the end of lighthearted programming at Syfy is here with {% work "Warehouse 13" %} and {% work "Eureka" %} ending (even though movies like {% work "Sharknado 2" %} are still coming)
