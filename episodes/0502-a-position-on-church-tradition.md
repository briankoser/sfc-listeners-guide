- Dogma: from Scripture, doesn't change
- Doctrine: from the Church (the Magisterium for Catholics), develops over time but is never reversed
- Discipline: practices we have, can change

The Magisterium is the church's authoritative body, guides church in dogma, doctrine, and discipline.

The individuals are fallible but the group is infallibly guided by the Holy Spirit.

Why do we need anything apart from the Bible? We didn't always have the complete Bible. People interpret the Bible differently.

Apostolic succession in the first Jerusalem Council (Acts 15)

Paul talks about traditions: 1 Cor. 11:2, 1 Thes. 2:15, 2 Tim. 2:2

Sola scriptura is not in the Bible

{% quotes podcast_file_url, quotes[0] %}

If apostolic tradition is how the church started, how do you know it stopped?

Sola scriptura makes each Christian their own magisterium.

With sola scriptura, either every Christian that disagrees with you is not right with God, or we need an authority beyond scripture.

How can you tell the church hasn't gone wrong? Humans on earth are obviously fallible.
