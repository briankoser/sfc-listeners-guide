        quote: Hey guys, Allan calling in. Just listened to the Dinner and a Movie episode, and I just wanted to comment that if you really want to get to 5000 downloads every episode, just keep knocking it out of the park like that episode. I mean, what we're looking for as listeners is twenty-five awkward seconds of picturing Ben just staring at a recording device on a table at Leeann Chin while we listen to background traffic noise. Podcast gold, guys, podcast gold. Keep up the good work, hope to get together with you sometime this summer, talk to you soon, bye bye.

      - b: If I didn't know you were doing that goal, I'd think, I hope Matt's marriage is doing okay.
