# Other Views on Hell

## Christian Universalism

Presented in Gerry Beauchemin's {% work "Hope Beyond Hell" %} and Rob Bell's {% work "Love Wins" %}

Matt and Daniel Butcher got a picture with an angry Rob Bell.

The view is everyone eventually gets out of hell.

Ben points out that this makes hell into purgatory.

The early church fathers uniformly held the traditional view.

Seth Heasley recommended {% work "All You Want to Know About Hell " %} by Steve Gregg for further thoughts on Christian Universalism and Annihilationism.



## Annihilationism

The soul is not immortal. You suffer for a time and then eventually get removed from existence.

This view originated in the 18th century with the Millerites, from which the Jehovah's Witnesses and Seventh-Day Adventists split.

Seventh-Day Adventists originated Young Earth Creationism as well. The rapture also originated in the 18th century.
