Ben is excited for Ivan Drago's return.

Melissa sent feedback for Indiana Jones, aesthetics, VidAngel, {% work "Spider-Man: Homecoming" %}, Matt's children, and Disney. Basically, Ben was right.

Mike points out that the genres of the stories in {% work "Hyperion" %} follow the history of science fiction (starting with a monster story, ending with cyberpunk).
