# Opening
Matt started saying the title at the beginning of the episode for blind people. Ben doesn't believe blind people use the internet. <q class="archivist inline">They use <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen_reader">screen readers</a>.</q>

If you had to lose one of the five senses, which would you choose? Matt and Ben both choose smell. 

Ben says if you lost the sense of touch you'd be paralyzed. Matt disagrees.

  <q class="matt">On the other hand though, it would suck to not have any feeling.</q>
  <q class="ben">Well yeah. How would you know if you're naked?</q>
  <q class="matt">Well you would know cuz you can look with your eyes.</q>
  <q class="ben">Not if you lose that one too. Like what if you lost sight and touch? </q>
  <q class="matt">Oh, that would suck.</q>
  <q class="ben">You would never know if you were naked.</q>
  <q class="matt">You would never know if people were, like, kicking you...</q>
  <q class="ben">Yeah!</q>
  <q class="ben">Well, you would hear them kicking you.</q>

How did Helen Keller do it? 



# Main Topic
Matt wants Batman to die because this might be the only chance to do that in film.

Ben predicts that Bane will no longer be an unintelligent character in DC comics. <q class="archivist">According to my <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bane_(DC_Comics)">brief Wikipedia research</a>, Bane was always intelligent in the comics. Because of the false premise this is neither a true nor false prophecy.</q>



# Closing
Ben and Matt "sing" along to the <i class="work-title">Batman: The Animated Series</i> theme.

  <q class="matt">What if he is the villain in the Superman movie? Not the new one [<i class="work-title">Man of Steel</i>].</q>
  <q class="ben">But then Superman would have to win and that would suck.</q>
  <q class="matt">What if he kills Superman?</q>
  <q class="ben">I'd love that.</q>
  <q class="matt">"Evil Batman Kills Superman"? Just call the movie that and everybody would go see it.</q>
