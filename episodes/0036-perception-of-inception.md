# Opening
Ben and Matt switch roles for the opening because Matt will be taking the lead on the podcast.

Ben has pulled back from the podcast since August because of Greek class and personal family matters.

Ben is now executive pastor at Epic Life Church.

Skip is still lead pastor.

Lian Chin is the Chinese restaurant where The Life Report was conceived.

In January, the podcast will be biweekly.

Ben is only going to appear every other episode (once a month).

Matt has recorded [Christmas albums](https://soundcloud.com/lswidbin).



# News
Ben finished <i class="work-title">The Wire</i> and says it's the greatest show ever made.

  <span class="quote-context is-size-6">Matt dreamed a girl that he had a crush on in first grade was mean to him on the playground, breaking his crush in real life.</span>
  <q class="matt">Take that, 'Jenny'!</q>
</div>



# Main Topic
Matt commits to watching <i class="work-title">The Shawshank Redemption</i> by next episode. 

Is the whole movie a dream? 

James asks, what kind of memories are we making for ourselves and for others? 

Do you agree with Cobb that reality doesn't matter? Is perception more important than reality? 

If you woke up in a world without Christianity, and realized that you dreamed your whole life, would you continue to be a Christian?

<q class="archivist">I'd like to think if this happened to me, my response would be the same as Puddleglum in <i class="work-title">The Silver Chair</i>. While the heroes are trapped underground, the villain tries to convince them that they only imagined the world above ground. Puddleglum responds with maybe my favorite theological statement and favorite moment in <i class="work-title">The Chronicles of Narnia</i> (emphasis mine):</q>

<blockquote>
<p>All you've been saying is quite right, I shouldn't wonder. I'm a chap who always liked to know the worst and then put the best face I can on it. So I won't deny any of what you said. But there's one thing more to be said, even so. Suppose we have only dreamed, or made up, all those things--trees and grass and sun and moon and stars and Aslan himself. Supose we have. Then all I can say is that, in that case, the made-up things seem a good deal more important than the real ones. Suppose this black pit of a kingdom of yours is the only world. Well, it strikes me as a pretty poor one. And that's a funny thing, when you come to think of it. We're just babies making up a game, if you're right. But four babies playing a game can make a play-world which licks your real world hollow. That's why I'm going to stand by the play-world. I'm on Aslan's side even if there isn't any Aslan to lead it. <em>I'm going to live as like a Narnian as I can even if there isn't any Narnia.</em></p>

Feedback on <a href="/episodes/0010-duel-of-the-fates">â„– 10 Duel of the Fates</a> from Taylor:

If you lock someone in a room without telling them, and they never find out, but decide to stay in the room, did they still have a free choice? Did they have free will when they chose to stay in the room, even though they couldn't have left?

Ben posits another scenario: what if the door is unlocked, but the person doesn't realize there even is a door? <q class="archivist inline">I'm not sure that this scenario applies to Christianity.</q>

Last episode in Rebel Underground Studios (Ben's house). After this episode they're moving the equipment to Matt's place.
