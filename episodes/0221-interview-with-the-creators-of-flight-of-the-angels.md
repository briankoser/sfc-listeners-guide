First recording in Rebel Underground Studios since Season 1.

The Reinis traveled down to record in studio.

Matt and Ben started the episode sharing a mic, then made the guests share instead. 

Ben is taller than both hosts imagined. 

Allan is Aaron's father.

Tom Bombadil represents the ideal pacifist. Tolkien used him to represent the ideal to strive for, but an impossibility to achieve in the real world.

  <q class="matt">I hope this doesn't come off as a joke. I'm actually interested: did Ben's review where he brought up that it was mostly an evangelical Christian base in the book, did his review when he brought that up, did that influence your decision to add these other elements in?</q>
  <q data-name="Allan Reini">Under oath, I will say...yes.</q>
  <q class="matt">Wow.</q>
  <q class="ben">So, influences on the series: Star Wars, Star Trek, Blade Runner...Ben De Bono.</q>

Ben is Right: Future <i class="work-title">Flight of the Angels</i> books will include non-evangelical Christians

October 2014 is the Reini's release date goal for the sequel. <q class="archivist inline">They released it only five years later, not bad</q>



# Closing
It's the three-year anniversary of the podcast.
