# Opening
Joss Whedon liked <i class="work-title">Iron Man 3</i> and said it will be hard to top with <i class="work-title">Avengers 2</i>.

Ben is disappointed that Joss Whedon has betrayed his philosophy of "story should always have a purpose".

<div class="quote">

  <q class="ben">Joss Whedon has, for the sake of being a fanboy, completely betrayed his set of principles that made him famous in the first place.</q>
  <q class="matt">Wow. I hope he's listening to this. Joss, we want you on the show. We're not going to make you answer for your crimes, but we just want to talk it out.</q>
</div>

Ben bought Matt <i class="work-title">The 5-Minute Iliad and Other Instant Classics: Great Books For The Short Attention Span</i> by Greg Nagan for his birthday.

# Feedback

Noah donated to the show, so they read his 5-page email.

Noah asks for a new rule: no talking over the "Ben is Right" clip

<div class="quote">
  {% timeLink podcast_file_url, '51:16' %}
  <span class="quote-context is-size-6">Noah compares weird bronies to sinful Catholics</span>
  <q class="ben">Here's the difference, Noah: you don't have a brony pope to help you sort it out. So take that, protestants! And bronies. Kill two birds with one stone there.</q>
  <q class="matt">Take that, bronies!</q>
</div>

Noah's sister drew a cartoon version of Ben. Ben says he needs Noah to email it to him.
