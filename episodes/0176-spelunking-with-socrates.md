Plato and the allegory of the cave

[School of Athens painting](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_School_of_Athens#/media/File%3A%22The_School_of_Athens%22_by_Raffaello_Sanzio_da_Urbino.jpg)

We have no writing from Socrates

Questions in <i class="work-title">The Republic</i>: what is justice? What is the perfectly just state?

The allegory of the cave introduces platonic forms 

Applied to storytelling: stories are shadows reflecting reality

God presents the Bible as narrative

Ben's favorite saint is Augustine

In [The Catholic Controversy](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/770549.The_Catholic_Controversy), Francis de Sales defends Catholicism against Protestantism

Why is the platonic dualistic view of "spirit, good; flesh, bad" so popular in Christianity? That duality was foreign to 1st-century Jews.

How much of Christianity can only be understood "from the inside"? To a non-Christian, it's just shadows.

<q class="archivist">There is a retired podcast, Flip the Table, that reviewed cheesy, weird, and obscure board games. Think 372 Pages for board games; in fact, they've mentioned MST3K as an inspiration. It's probably my second favorite podcast. Anyway, they reviewed <a href="https://tableflipsyou.blogspot.com/2016/10/episode-98-lost.html">LOST: The Game on episode 98</a>.</q>
