- Revival: continuation after a break
- Reboot: starting over but nothing from before matters
- Remake: cross-culture new version
- Reimagining: reboot with a very different take

{% work "The X-Files" %} is returning for 6 episodes.

The revival nobody asked for: {% work "Coach" %} is returning.

{% work "The Muppet Show" %} is returning.

Ben likes the Muppets.

{% work "Full House" %} is returning as {% work "Fuller House" %},

Shows are returning to make their back catalogs more valuable to streaming services. Since {% work "Firefly" %} has so few episodes and an ensemble cast, Ben predicts it will never return.

{% quotes podcast_file_url, quotes[0] %}

Ben thinks the shows that return will be low budget, small cast, and have large back catalogs.

{% countdown countdowns.will %}

Ben is skeptical about Matt's list.

Nostalgia and hype combined make a pop culture work popular.

{% work "Batman 1966" %} is returning as an animated movie.

{% countdown countdowns.want %}

Ben would trade every episode of {% work "Game of Thrones" %} so far for a completion of {% work "Deadwood" %}. He knows it will never return.
{% arc %}It returned as a movie in 2019!{% endarc %}
