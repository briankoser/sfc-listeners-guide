Six listeners have listened to every episode to date. Including Matt, seven people have heard everything.

Casey is on the list even though she skipped the X-Files episodes. She did listen to The Life Report.

They interviewed each of the six over email. "deadspace" never responded, so Ben will answer for him or her.
