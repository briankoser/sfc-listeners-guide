Natural religion versus dogmatic religion

Is America a Christian nation? Depends on your definition.

Gaiman was influenced by his road trips like Tolkien was by his walking tours.

Atheists claim to only worship one fewer god than Christians, Jews, and Muslims. The flaw in that argument is in assuming an equivalence between natural and dogmatic religion. For example, we no longer believe the Greek myths, but we do believe the myths about the founding of America; natural religion still exists even though we don't call them "gods".
