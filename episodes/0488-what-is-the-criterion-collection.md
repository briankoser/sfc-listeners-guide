Criterion distributes classic, foreign, and arthouse films.

They innovated disc special features and correct aspect ratios for home video.

Watch {% work "The Passion of Joan of Arc" %} from Criterion instead of Hulu because for the orchestral soundtrack they created.

The {% work "Life Aquatic with Steve Zizou" %} is maybe Ben's favorite movie.

Matt suggests doing a {% work "Metropolis" %} commentary episode.

Ben recommends starting with {% work "Yojimbo" %} when you start watching Kurasawa.
