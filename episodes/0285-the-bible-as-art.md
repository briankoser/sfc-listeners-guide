Now I know there are some listeners out there that are wondering this, and so just as a public service to them, I'm going to ask you the question: if one of our listeners out there wants to get their hands on the dirtiest version of Song of Songs, where can our listeners get it from?"

Dan Simmons, an agnostic, looks for beauty over strict accuracy in translations. For example, his favorite Bible translation is the King James Version. 

Ways Christians read the Bible:
- study
- devotional 
- liturgical

Is it appropriate to read the Bible as literature? 

Considerations for Bible translation:
- readability 
- accuracy 
- theology

When translating secular literature, theology is not a concern, but aesthetics is.

Should aesthetics be more of a concern in the poetry rather than the theology-heavy books?
