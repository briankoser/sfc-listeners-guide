archivist_note: "Ben says that conception is the only point that makes sense for us to say scientifically that life begins, and so this is when a soul enters a body. I think you could also make the case for when the heart starts beating. This gets around the question that identical twins pose: if the soul enters the body at conception, what happens when the twins split after a few days? Does another soul get created? Does the first soul split in two?"
