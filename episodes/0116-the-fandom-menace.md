# Main Topic

## Types of Stories
- Mythology - answering the big questions
- Allegory - communicating morals
- Thematic Narrative - exploring themes
- Philosophical/Political Story - develops philosophical/political position
- Visceral - pure entertainment

Fandom is almost a new, separate type of story, where the draw is the investment in the world.

Does fandom distract us from what we're supposed to get from stories?

Is fandom a problem? Ben says yes, Matt says maybe.

  <q class="ben">You're the guy who hears about child labor sweatshops in third-world countries, says, 'That sucks,' and then heads off to a mall to go buy Nikes.</q>
  <q class="matt">Thanks. Thanks, Ben.</q>
  <q class="ben">I'm the guy who is the wild-haired crazy person standing outside the store selling Nikes demanding that everyone else boycott while everyone just walks past me and says, 'What the [bleep] is his problem?'</q>
  <q class="matt">*sigh*</q>
  <q class="ben">That's not a swear!</q>
  <q class="matt">I'm still gonna beep it out.</q>
