    lines:
      - m: So we're recording--without their permission--their next episode.
      - b: Well, I think we're doing it as a gift.
      - m: And then we're also hijacking one of their episodes and using it as a Sci-Fi Christian episode.
      - b: Yeah, you don't--if you hand a homeless guy a jacket, you don't ask their permission first.
      - m: I don't--
      - b: Maybe you do.
      - m: That doesn't make any sense.
      - b: Well, this is charity.
      - m: I guess you probably--I would go up to him and say, 'Hey, I've got this jacket, would you like it?'
      - b: You see him freezing in the snow--
      - m: I'd still say, 'Would you like this?'
      - b: He's like, blue.
      - m: Well, okay, if he's unconscious, then maybe.
      - b: Well, isn't the Green Screen basically unconscious at this point?
  - time: "12:01"
    lines:
      - b: When you got a name like 'Diggle', you don't expect to go far in life.
