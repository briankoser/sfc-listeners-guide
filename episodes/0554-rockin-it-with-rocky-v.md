Rocky IV was bad-fun. Rocky V was bad-not fun.

Where is the robot?

Matt noticed that Tommy Gun wore the exact same sweater as Rocky when he came to his house to break up. Ben thinks that part of their training was going sweater shopping together.

If Matt has a son, he will consider naming him "Rocky Anderson".
