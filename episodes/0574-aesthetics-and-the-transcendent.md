The answer to Brian's question, what does this look like in day-to-day life? Just read Shakespeare to your kids?

We all need to participate in preserving our culture, now that the academics have discarded it.

Geniuses slice through restrictions.

Man is an irrational animal. Scott Adams: We make decisions informed by rationality but ultimately extra-rationally.

Great art is quasi-religious.

- High functions of religion: appease the gods, distill of morality, human salvation
- Low functions of religion: create community, preserve tradition, inspire social work

The purpose of religion is to encounter the transcendent and the Transcendent. 

The goal is not to get back to Eden but to get back to God.

The Mount of Transfiguration and the Passion in the Garden are nearly identical narratives.

All bad religion stems from losing the Transcendent.

Don't give away cars to trick people into coming to church: give them an encounter with the Transcendent.

Liturgy is an arbitrary simplicity of doing small things well to commune with the transcendent.

Art brings us to the transcendent in a similar way to a religious liturgy.

# Application
1. Get beyond yourself when experiencing art.
2. See preserving art as a quasi-liturgical experience. Be faithful to the small thing of experiencing art.
3. Preserving art is a human duty.

Just read Shakespeare to your kids? Kind of!

You can't just have a relationship; your religion is the way you have a relationship with God.
