Pre-moderns did not distinguish between natural and supernatural. Dante's {% work "Comedy" %} is the most complete pre-modern picture; Lewis's {% work "The Discarded Image" %} explains this model.

The New Atheists are moderns or neo-moderns.

Postmodernism developed through Marx on the left and fascists on the right. Fascism failed hard but is making a comeback. Marxism has been more of a gradual failure.

No one is completely postmodernist because it is anti everything: anti-religion, anti-science, anti-reason.

If you reject postmodernism, what actions should you take?

## What Not To Do
### Don't change the world

Not all change is for the better.

Hitler and Marx changed the world.

### Don't look for a messiah

American politicians now position themselves as messiahs.

You are a mess, so you will probably not change the world for the best. You can create a literal hell for yourself and others.

Upcoming video series: The Gospel According to Dante

Good intentions aren't enough: {% work "When Helping Hurts" %} shows that sometimes charity does more harm than good.

Richard Rohr, not recommended except for his book on men {% work "Adam's Return" %}, lists five hard truths of masculinity:
1. Life is hard
2. You are not important
3. Your life is not about you
4. You are not in control
5. You are going to die

## What To Do

Mother Theresa: If you want to change the world, go home and love your family.

{% quotes podcast_file_url, quotes[0] %}

Samwise Gamgee realizes he can't use The Ring, even to transform the world for good. It's arrogant to reach beyond your realm.

Jordan Peterson: sort yourself out. How can you change the world if you can't even clean your room?

Our purpose is to live well. Be a good spouse, good parent, good child.

Tarkovsky's {% work "The Sacrifice" %}: find a simple thing to do faithfully
