# Opening 
Matt says Rick Lee James is the guest who has appeared most.
{% arc %}Very close. This is Rick's 7th episode; Ben Avery has guested 8 times.{% endarc %}



# Voices in My Head 
Rick points out that the original quote is, "With great power, there must come great responsibility". Rick says great power doesn't automatically come with great responsibility.
{% arc %}The original and the popular versions are saying the same thing: one uses responsibility to mean "acting responsibly" and the other to mean "the duty to act responsibly".{% endarc %}
