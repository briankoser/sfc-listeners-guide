{% countdown countdowns.dontHoldUp %}

Ben is dreading his upcoming Disney World vacation. 

{% countdown countdowns.mightSuck %}

Ben made a Chip 'n Dale joke that Matt edited out. 

Matt put {% work "The Rocketeer" %} on his marriage registry. Ben thinks it would totally hold up and is going to buy it for Matt.

Matt had a toaster oven but wanted a new one so he put it on his registry. Someone already bought him a new one. Ben asked to buy his old one and Matt gave it to him.

Ben started biking this year. Today he did his first mile in under three minutes. Matt ran another half marathon.

  <span class="quote-context is-size-6">Ben describes the premise of the video game {% work "DOOM" %}.</span>
  <q class="ben">You're on a moon base, and they open up a portal and demons come through.</q>
  <q class="matt">Why don't they just not open the portal?</q>
  <q class="ben">They didn't know that it was gonna do that. If you're a scientist, you're experimenting with a portal, you don't think it's gonna go to hell, but sometimes it does.</q>

Ben is Right: video games let you choose your own adventure, so the book series is unnecessary

  <q class="matt">I just started watching this past weekend {% work "Downton Abbey" %}.</q>
  <q class="ben">Yeah, there you go.</q>
  <q class="matt">Upon your recommendation.</q>
  <q class="ben">There you go. It's a good show.</q>
  <q class="matt">And so there's things—</q>
  <q class="ben">Are you watching it with Des?</q>
  <q class="matt">She's already seen it, so I'm just watching it alone.</q>
  <q class="ben">Oh.</q>
  <q class="matt">Is that okay?</q>
  <q class="ben">It's a little iffy.</q>

  <q class="ben">*laughs* Painful memories.</q>
  <q class="matt">How was it having a dad that you could do cool things with?</q>
  <q class="ben">It was great, Matt! You should try it out sometime.</q>
  <q class="matt">Oh...</q>

Matt is reading {% work "Morning Glories" %} monthly.
