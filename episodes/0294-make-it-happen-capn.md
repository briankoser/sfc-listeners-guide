      - m: Everybody's talking about how awesome it is that Civil War is gonna come to the big screen. 
      - b: Yeah.
      - m: But you need to realize, Civil War works in comics because there's hundreds of heroes and villains. It does not work in a universe where there are five heroes.
      - b: You could literally--if you wanted to do the Superhero Registration Act, you could register all current superheroes on a Post-It note.
