Matt organized every episode by category and topic.

{% quotes podcast_file_url, quotes[0] %}
{% arc %}The current version of The Sci-Fi Christian website has these categories. sfc.blue is obviously an expansion on the idea.{% endarc %}

Ben picks categories at random and Matt lists those episodes.

Matt also reorganizes the categories.

Ben is working while podcasting.

They can't remember what {% episodeLink 237 %} is about, so they listen to the episodes until they figure it out.

Matt wants to revisit Top 20 Superheroes for episode 460. {% arc %}It ended up being "Introduction to Paradise Lost".{% endarc %}
