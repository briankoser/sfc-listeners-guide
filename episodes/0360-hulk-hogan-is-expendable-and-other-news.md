odd_opening: Matt does a Hulk Hogan impression
questions_for_matt:
  - Batman will be in Suicide Squad. Does it improve the chances that it's a good movie?
  - The Hunger Games team's Odyssey movie will now be two movies. Does that increase or decrease the chances that it enrages Ben?
  - Tomorrowland has flopped. Can Lindelhoff's legacy be saved?
  - Chris Pratt pre-apologized for anything offensive he would say in Jurassic World interview. If Ben was sent on a press junket, how many apologies would he have to make?
quotes:
  - time: "31:53"
    context: Matt thinks Matthew McConaughey could play Mordo in the Doctor Strange movie.
    lines:
      - b: If he is Mordo, then I hope when he signs the contract he says, 'This isn't gonna happen unless you offer me More Dough.'
