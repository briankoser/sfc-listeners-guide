Doug Payton happened to be in town and invited himself on the show.

  <q class="matt">Speaking of you kind of inviting yourself onto the podcast, I do have an opening question: how dare you? And as a follow-up: who do you think you are?</q>

Doug wants more family-friendly TV and movies. 

Ben wants more quality, and entertainment geared towards either children or adults instead of in the "murky middle ground".

The Bible isn't family-friendly. 

{% work "The Sound of Music" %} was rated G even with Nazis and people getting shot.

Ben's secret to not watching TV and movies with his wife: agree to watch, then complain until she doesn't want to watch with you.

The Bible isn't always positive and encouraging. Christianity is about more than happiness.
