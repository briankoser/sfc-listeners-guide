  <q data-name="Jayce">Koby has a cool name. I agree with him.</q>
  <q class="koby">Amen brother!</q>
  <q class="ben">Yeah, he has a few of them.</q>
  <q class="koby">What does that even mean?</q>
</div>

In the original script, Jesus was an emissary of the aliens. Steve says it's blasphemous to write fiction like that. {% arc %}I actually like it (when not done tackily) and don't see the harm. I would think engagement, even from a position of unbelief, is preferable to ignorance and ignoring of Christianity.{% endarc %}

Steve wants the sequel to not have religious imagery.
