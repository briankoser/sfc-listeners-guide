In the original script, Jesus was an emissary of the aliens. Steve says it's blasphemous to write fiction like that. <q class="archivist inline">I actually like it (when not done tackily) and don't see the harm. I would think engagement, even from a position of unbelief, is preferable to ignorance and ignoring of Christianity.</q>

Steve wants the sequel to not have religious imagery.
