quotes:
  - time: "47:04"
    context: There are always two empty chairs in the studio. Ben uses Jesus sitting in the room speaking as an example of revelation.
    lines:
      - m: We do always just leave this chair empty.
      - b: No, it's not empty. What if he wanted to sit there right now? Your pants are on it.
      - m: I know, my pants are hanging here, I got a laptop case. I mean, what if this was the week Jesus wanted to fill the chair?
      - b: We do have two empty chairs. Just for the Father and Son; Holy Spirit's gotta stand.
  - time: "47:37"
    lines:
      - b: Obviously I agree with what the church is teaching us here through the second Vatican Council--
      - m: "I don't want to interrupt, but I just want the listeners to just know, just in case there's anyone wondering: the pants that are on the chair are a different pair of pants than the ones I'm currently wearing."
      - b: That's true. Not since The Life Report have we done a show where Matt did not wear pants.
      - m: "That's also not true. I've always--one of my main podcasting rules has been: wear pants."
  - time: "48:22"
    lines: 
      - b: Are you an optimistic agnostic or a pessimistic agnostic regarding Matt's wearing of pants?
  - time: "54:04"
    lines:
      - m: I don't think any of us want even our enemies to suffer for eternity.
      - b: Not for eternity.

Ben uses the framework from The Gospel Coalition's article [What About Those Who Haven’t Heard?](https://www.thegospelcoalition.org/article/what-about-those-who-havent-heard/) as a starting point. From most exlusive to most inclusive:

# 1. Church Exclusivism
- Must be a member of a certain church
- Ultra-traditional Catholics

# 2. Gospel Exclusivism
- Must be saved through the gospel
- Reformed, John Piper

# 3. Special Revelation Exclusivism
- Could be saved, for example, by a vision of Jesus
- Non-fundamentalist conservative Evangelical, Catholic

# 4. Agnosticism (as to the fate of the unevangelized)
- Not sure exactly who will make it
- Pessimistic (not sure and no evidence indicates it) or optimistic (not sure but I hope God saves all or most)
- Non-fundamentalist conservative Evangelical, Catholic
- J. I. Packer (pessimistic), Hans Urs von Balthasar (optimistic), John Stott (optimistic)

# 5. General Revelation Inclusivism
- More than a hope that general revelation saves
- Fewer non-fundamentalist conservative Evangelical, Catholic

# 6. World Religions Inclusivism
- Other religions can save
- With reservations (Christians in other religions) or enthusiastic (should find God in your culture's religion)
- C. S. Lewis (with reservations), Karl Rahner (with reservations), Hans Küng (enthusiastic)

# 7. Postmortem Evangelism
- Everyone in hell will eventually be saved
- Essentially turns hell into purgatory
- Rob Bell, George MacDonald

# 8. Universalism
- Everyone will be saved (some like Origen would even include Satan)
- Unitarians
- Origen (this is why he isn't a saint)

# 9. Pluralism
- Everyone will be saved and Christianity is not a better way to God than other religions



Believing 1-6 are compatible with orthodox Christianity.

In Lumen Gentium, the Catholic church affirmed that #6 is possible.

Ben believes #4 (optmistic orthodox) and is sympathetic to #5 and C. S. Lewis-style #6.
