It's easily the best year of book reading in Matt's life.

The first five minutes are Ben listing all his other title ideas.

Ben says the plot is the least interesting part of the book. Re-reading and thinking about the book greatly improves it.

On this read, Ben thought about the role of messiah Jesus played. In contrast, the Jews wanted a militant messiah, like Paul.

Ben discussed {% work "Lawrence of Arabia" %} in depth with Allan and Andrew Reini at Reinifest.
