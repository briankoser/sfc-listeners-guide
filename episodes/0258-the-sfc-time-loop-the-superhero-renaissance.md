# Main Topic
## Phases of Superhero Movies

1. Early (1978-1997, <i class="work-title">Superman</i>-<i class="work-title">Batman and Robin</i>)
2. Rennaisance (2000-2005, includes X-Men 1-2, Spider-Man 1-2, <i class="work-title">Batman Begins</i>)
3. Fatigue (2005-2008, includes <i class="work-title">Ghost Rider</i>, <i class="work-title">Electra</i>, <i class="work-title">Punisher</i>, <i class="work-title">Fantastic Four</i>, <i class="work-title">Superman Returns</i>, <i class="work-title">X-Men 3</i>, <i class="work-title">Wolverine</i>, <i class="work-title">Spider-Man 3</i>)
4. Rejuvenation (2008-, <i class="work-title">The Dark Knight</i>, <i class="work-title">Iron Man</i>)

## Factors to determine the future of the superhero genre

1. Will <i class="work-title">The Avengers</i> succeed?
2. What happens to Batman post-Nolan?
3. Will <i class="work-title">X-Men: First Class</i> be a successful spinoff?
4. Will <i class="work-title">The Amazing Spider-Man</i> be a successful reboot?
5. Can lesser-known characters like <i class="work-title">Thor</i>, <i class="work-title">Captain America</i>, and <i class="work-title">Green Lantern</i> be successful?

        <li>It will be awesome
        <li><i class="work-title">Captain America</i> successful, <i class="work-title">Thor</i> will be the best of the three but will get a so-so reception, <i class="work-title">Green Lantern</i> bad

Hopefully superhero movies will help bring us through postmodernism.

The genre is unique because it's currently the only one that's mythological.

Will directors and studios see the success of <i class="work-title">The Dark Knight</i> as caused by it's dark and gritty feel or because it had things deep and objective to say? <q class="archivist inline">Sorry guys, they took dark and gritty</q>
