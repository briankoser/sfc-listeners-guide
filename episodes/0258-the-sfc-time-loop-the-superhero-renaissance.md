# Main Topic
## Phases of Superhero Movies

1. Early (1978-1997, {% work "Superman" %}-{% work "Batman and Robin" %})
2. Rennaisance (2000-2005, includes X-Men 1-2, Spider-Man 1-2, {% work "Batman Begins" %})
3. Fatigue (2005-2008, includes {% work "Ghost Rider" %}, {% work "Electra" %}, {% work "Punisher" %}, {% work "Fantastic Four" %}, {% work "Superman Returns" %}, {% work "X-Men 3" %}, {% work "Wolverine" %}, {% work "Spider-Man 3" %})
4. Rejuvenation (2008-, {% work "The Dark Knight" %}, {% work "Iron Man" %})

## Factors to determine the future of the superhero genre

1. Will {% work "The Avengers" %} succeed?
2. What happens to Batman post-Nolan?
3. Will {% work "X-Men: First Class" %} be a successful spinoff?
4. Will {% work "The Amazing Spider-Man" %} be a successful reboot?
5. Can lesser-known characters like {% work "Thor" %}, {% work "Captain America" %}, and {% work "Green Lantern" %} be successful?

Hopefully superhero movies will help bring us through postmodernism.

The genre is unique because it's currently the only one that's mythological.

Will directors and studios see the success of {% work "The Dark Knight" %} as caused by it's dark and gritty feel or because it had things deep and objective to say? <q class="archivist inline">Sorry guys, they took dark and gritty</q>
