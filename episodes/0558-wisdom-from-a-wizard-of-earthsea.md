{% work "The Lord of the Rings" %} feels right to have a map. {% work "The Chronicles of Narnia" %} is more of a fairy tale and a map of Narnia feels wrong. In that way, Earthsea is more like Narnia.

Matt invents the idea of a wizard detective. Ben says it might already exist: he bought an audiobook called {% work "Warlock Holmes" %}.

Ged confronts his shadow self, a Jungian symbol for the dark part of our identity. Jordan Peterson says we all think if we lived in Nazi Germany we would have been the ones helping the Jews; but most of us would have gone along with society.

Ben explains the humor of {% work "Don Quixote" %}, the next readalong.
