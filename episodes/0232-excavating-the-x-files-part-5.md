  <q class="matt">Now when I hear 'stiletto'—</q>
  <q class="ben">Like high heels?</q>
  <q class="matt">It's usually used to talk about high heels. But a little research will tell you it's also—</q>
  <q class="ben">A knife.</q>

  <q class="matt">That we do love shoes?</q>
  <q class="ben">Well, I guess I don't have strong feelings about shoes. I mean, I appreciate that they exist.</q>
  <q class="matt">I feel like you would be a shoe-lover. Like a lover of shoes.</q>

Chris Carter says "The Musings of the Cigarette Smoking Man" is no longer canon. Matt wants to go back and watch the episode at the end. 

Ben still likes the show but is seeing a lot of problems.
