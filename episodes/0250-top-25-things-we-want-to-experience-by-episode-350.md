  <q class="matt">I'm gonna predict...3.5, cuz I don't know what to expect. I have no idea what it's about, other than rabbits.</q>
  <q class="ben">It's <i class="work-title">The Aeneid</i>, told with rabbits.</q>
  <q class="matt">...all I know is rabbits.</q>
</div>

Ben suggests listening to <i class="work-title">Watership Down</i> and the <i class="work-title">Ocean at the End of the Lane</i> instead of reading them.
