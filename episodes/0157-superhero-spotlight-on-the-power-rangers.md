# Opening
Strangers and Aliens didn't send the comics, so Matt declares the sale of Koby void. 



# Main Topic
{% timeLink podcast_file_url, '4:45' %} Ben leaves a voicemail challenging Koby to list his top 5 themes from {% workTitle "Power Rangers" %}.

<div class="top-five">
  <h2 class="has-text-centered">Top 5 themes from {% workTitle "Power Rangers" %}</h2>
  <div class="columns">
    <div class="column koby">
      <h3>Koby</h3>
      <ol reversed>
        <li><s>Sacrifice</s> Teamwork
        <li>Overcoming evil
        <li>&nbsp;
        <li>Hope
        <li>&nbsp;
      </ol>
    </div>

Matt says the show is geared towards children age 5-7.

Koby likes a lot of the show but admits there are some bad seasons. 

There is a fake religion based off the show called "Rangerism".
