After three years, <i class="work-title">The Stand</i> readalong is complete.

Ben read the book in three days in high school.

Stephen King wrote <i class="work-title">The Stand</i> as an American fantasy epic, like <i class="work-title">The Lord of the Rings</i>.

Stephen King got his worst writer's block during the writing. He didn't quit only because he was already two-thirds through the book.

Ben's off-the-top-of-the-head recommended Dark Tower reading list:
- The Dark Tower series
- The Wind in the Keyhole
- Eyes of the Dragon
- The Talisman
- Black House
- Hearts in Atlantis
