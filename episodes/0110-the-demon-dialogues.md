Ben beatboxes and uses the mic as a drum for the opening.

  <span class="quote-context is-size-6">Ben talks about his research on demons.</span>
  <q class="ben">The first place I went with this, because the Bible's—the information's pretty scattered and all over the place, so I was curious, as a Catholic, what does the Catechism have to say about demons.</q>
  <q class="matt">'Curious as a Catholic', it's like, 'as curious as a cat'.</q>
  <q class="ben">I was a curious Catholic.</q>
  <q class="matt">'Curious as a Catholic'. You know how those Catholics are so curious.</q>
  <q class="ben">We're curious little guys. And I believe—I don't have it open right in front of me unfortunately—</q>
  <q class="matt">I want us to make that a new phrase. That I want people to start saying in the streets.</q>
  <q class="ben">'Curious as a Catholic'?</q>
  <q class="matt">'I was curious as a Catholic so I decided to check out what was in that store.'</q>
</div>

Matt says angels are the interns of heaven. 

Did one third of the angels fall with Satan? Rev. 12:4 is often interpreted to support that view. 

If Ben could ask the pope one question, he would ask, "Batman or Superman"? 

Ben had a nightmare that the pope was a Green Bay Packers fan and held a Packers rally at the Vatican.

  <span class="quote-context is-size-6">They start to talk about demonic possession</span>
  <q class="matt">So, Catholic view: for or against?</q>
</div>

Matt was part of a group exorcism in Guatemala. 

Are angels corporeal? Did Gabriel have a body when he appeared to Mary?
