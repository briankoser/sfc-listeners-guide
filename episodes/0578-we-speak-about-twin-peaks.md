Discussion of the first two {% work "Twin Peaks" %} seasons and {% work "Fire Walk With Me" %}.

Who is Bob? Who is The Man From Another Place?

{% work "Dune" %} failing is the best thing that ever happened to David Lynch, because afterward he worked outside the studio system.

Red curtains and blue light are David Lynch's symbols for moving into dream space. Also moving through an object.

No one has ever interpreted {% work "Erasehead" %} the same way as David Lynch, and he refused to tell how he interpreted it.

The 1950s-aethetic wholesomeness is not fake; it's real but threatened by evil.

After Cooper gets trapped in the Black Lodge at the end of {% work "Twin Peaks" %} Season 2, {% work "Lost Highway" %} and {% work "Mulholland Drive" %} take place entirely in the Black Lodge. We leave the Black Lodge at the end of {% work "Inland Empire" %}. Because of that arc, Ben is convinced {% work "Twin Peaks: The Return" %} will have a happy ending. And if it doesn't, he will adjust his theory.

Electrical noises are evil in Lynch.
