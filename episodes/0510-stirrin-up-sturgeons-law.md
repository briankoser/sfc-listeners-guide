- Sturgeon's Law: 90% of anything is crap
- Crawford's Corollary: Should you ever find that less than 90% is crap, your standard is too low
- Critic's Corollary: 90% of people lack the taste necessary to determine what is crap
- Critic's Second Corollary: 90% of people criticize 90% of what they see, regardless of whether they can determine what is crap
- De Bono's Addendum: 10% of crap is innovative and influential

Most content from every genre is ephemeral

Time is the great sifter

Wheel of Time is not high quality, but did prove that a long fantasy series could succeed.
