<div class="quote">
  <q class="matt">Not all my dreams I had that I journaled about were sci-fi, but I picked ones that would be more appropriate for the show.</q>
  <q class="ben">Oh. Yikes.</q>
  <q class="matt">Not that any of my dreams were inappropriate! I meant sci-fi-themed or God-themed.</q>
</div>

Matt's deja vu theory: we're all a little bit psychic and we dream about the future, or our brain is smart enough to figure out the future and puts it in our dreams.

        <li>Ben hung out with George R. R. Martin, broke one of his vases, watched TV and discussed his books.
        <li>Ben hung out with Neil Gaiman, who declared them lifelong friends. Then he was a good demon that was trapped in an angelic cocoon by an angel bounty hunter.
        <li>Ben went to New York with Matt and got accused of murder.
        <li>Ben was the king of an alternate universe but got trapped in our universe. He got a construction job but was fired because he didn't know anything about construction.
        <li>Ben directed a children's play of <i class="work-title">Game of Thrones</i>.

        <li>Matt got to relive his life so he spent more time with his grandpa.
        <li>Matt could run fast like The Flash.

Matt "Toolbelt" Anderson was his nickname during their missions trip.



# Feedback
Mike Poteet had a dream where he travelled to random suburban houses in the TARDIS with Mitt Romney, eating their food and using their bathrooms.

Matt watches for the <i class="work-title">LOST</i> numbers in real life.
