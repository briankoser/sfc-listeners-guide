  <q class="matt">So this is what I'm thinking: I don't think we're going to see a Justice League movie.</q>
  <q class="ben">Really.</q>
  <q class="matt">I think it's gonna be—I think the first movie will be 'Superman-Batman'. Or another title for it, back in—</q>
  <q class="ben">'World's Finest'?</q>
  <q class="matt">Yeah, 'World's Finest'. Long time ago, it was a team-up book called, 'World's Finest'. I don't know if that would translate well to today's crowd, so it might just go by 'Superman-Batman'.</q>
  <q class="ben">Yeah.</q>
  <q class="matt">Or 'Batman-Superman'. Who gets top billing?</q>
  <q class="ben">Batman.</q>
  <q class="matt">Yeah, 'Batman-Superman'. So, that's my prediction: you're not going to see <i class="work-title">Justice League</i>, they need to work us into this world.</q>
