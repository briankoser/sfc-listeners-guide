  <q class="ben">I have warmed up to it a little bit.</q>
  <q class="matt">Oh that's interesting. How come? </q>
  <q class="ben">Just because it's so absurd...it's like, you know, you have a friend who's just kind of dumb, and they just say dumb things, and yeah they're stupid but you like hanging out with them because they amuse you, and you learn all sorts of great stuff from them even though it's absolutely ridiculous, and they don't have anything actually sensible to say, there's just something kind of amusing about the relationship because of how absolutely absurd it is.</q>
  <q class="matt">Are you describing me?</q>
  <q class="ben">Maybe.</q>

Ben starts the rumor that Stan Lee and Ryan Reynolds are the same person (since they both appear in a lot of superhero movies).
