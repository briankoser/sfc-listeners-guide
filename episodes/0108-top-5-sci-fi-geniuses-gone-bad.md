Ben remembers that they used to gift autographed copies of their show notes from The Life Report.

Mike Poteet came up with a contest: describe in 75 words or fewer the novel Tolkien and Lewis could have co-wrote.

The prize is an autographed copy of a {% work "The Lord of the Rings" %}-themed devotional. 

Matt's latest fundraising scheme: for $15 he will record an audio description of a Geek Grab Bag of the donor's choice.

Matt's love for {% work "Reign of Fire" %} comes up again.

Ben thinks {% work "Temple of Doom" %} is worse than {% work "Kingdom of the Crystal Skull" %}.

{% countdown countdowns.comebacks %}

Matt and Ben's first idea for a podcast was a "Books of {% work "LOST" %}" podcast.

Matt wonders how many episodes they'd be at if they had split the episodes all along. Arc

Ben says the schedule is to release two episodes a week, with special appearances by Daniel and "Kory". So, no more Listener Feedback shows.

Ben jokes that he'll just stop forwarding feedback to Matt. {% arc %}For now it's a joke.{% endarc %}
