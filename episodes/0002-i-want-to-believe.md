# Opening
Ben and Matt's overall brand for their various media projects is currently "The Rebel Underground".

Their first "studio" is called "Rebel Underground Studios".

Matt and Ben play "rock scissors paper": Matt plays rock and Ben plays scissors.

Ben says "yes sir" a lot and "yeppers" once.

# Main Topic

The Bible is for humans and does not preclude things outside that context: for example, aliens.

If a flying saucer with aliens came to Earth, would you still be a Christian?



# Feedback
Ben forgot to mention the following Top 5 runners up in the previous episode: 
- Gattaca
- Ender's Game and Speaker for the Dead
- Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind
