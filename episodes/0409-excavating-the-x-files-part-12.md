The watched 17 episodes from Seasons 8 and 9. They took the last week off from podcasting to dedicate to {% work "The X-Files" %}.

Matt sent Ben a list of skippable episodes, but Ben felt like he had to "be a pal" and watched them all.

Ben gets an email inviting him to Ian's 40th birthday party. In Australia.

Ben wonders if they wasted their time. Matt thinks they only wasted the last two weeks.
