  <q class="ben">I'd like to have a friend named 'Frederick the Wise'.</q>
  <q class="matt">I tell people sometimes that I have a friend named 'Ben the Wise'.</q>
  <q class="ben">Yeah? Quite accurately. I never tell anyone that I have a friend named 'Matt the Wise'.</q>
  <q class="matt">You are my worst friend.</q>
