Should children read stories with morally grey material? 

Is it best for children to just have morally black and white stories so they learn morality? Should they experience morally grey stories to grapple with moral questions?

How much adult content (profanity, violence, sex) is acceptable? 

Why is violence more acceptable in any age range?

Is objectionable content required for high quality stories? 

If yes, is it OK to purposely give children lower-quality stories? 

Stories are more than entertainment.

Ben starts reading through Matt's currently reading list on Goodreads and points out how many books Matt is, in fact, not currently reading. To be continued after Matt updates the list with all the books he's started and not finished.
