  <q class="matt">When you found out I was really into sci-fi, what did you think?</q>
  <q data-name="Des">I think you're not that into it.</q>
  <q class="matt">Oh!</q>
  <q class="ben">I agree.</q>
  <q class="matt">This is an ongoing conversation.</q>
  <q class="ben">I agree.</q>
  <q class="matt">Don't tell the audience that I'm into sci-fi.</q>
  <q class="ben">He's not that into sci-fi.</q>

  <q class="matt">You found out that I was doing a podcast about science fiction and theology prior to us dating, like we were just friends.</q>

  <q class="ben">What is going to happen, and I'm not saying this is likely to happen, but we get halfway through Season 1 and Des is like, 'I don't like it. This is not a good show.'</q>
