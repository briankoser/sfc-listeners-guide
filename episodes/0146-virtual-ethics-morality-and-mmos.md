    title: Top 4 Reasons Ben Shouldn't Get a Parking Ticket
    ben:
      list:
        - No one explained to him that there were lots he couldn't park in.
        - The signage around the lots is inadequate and confusing. 
        - A warning would have been sufficient. 
        - It was an employee space and he is a student worker.

Is it moral to sell an item in a video game for real money since it's not a real object? Is it just selling entertainment in the same way as buying an experience like a movie theatre ticket? 

A father thought his son was playing a video game too much so he hired an in-game assassin to kill his son's character. 

Is killing someone in a game immoral? Is it defrauding someone to harass someone in a game because of out-of-game grudges? 

A couple Eve Online players ran a ponzi scheme in-game. Is that morally wrong if there were no rules against it? 

Are you disobeying an authority if you break a game's rules? If you cheat at checkers are you sinning against the creator of checkers? 

Ben thinks cheating at checkers is not a sin.
