  <q class="ben">And would you know, Matt, that there are some differences between us.</q>
  <q class="matt">You and I?</q>
  <q class="ben">Yeah. Because Catholics have a little bit more information on the Ark than you do.</q>
  <q class="matt">I bet the Catholics think they have it. In the Vatican.</q>
  <q class="ben">It's in the Vatican! Pope Francis goes to sleep on it every night.</q>

Some scholars think Josiah found the Ark along with the law.

1 Samuel 5 proves theologically the ark wouldn't have helped the Nazis.

Macabees says Jeremiah hid it in a cave. 

The Ethiopian orthodox church claims they have the real ark.

The Lemba people in South Africa claim that the ark self-destructed after they stole it.

If we found the ark today, would it still have power? Would you be the first one to touch it?
