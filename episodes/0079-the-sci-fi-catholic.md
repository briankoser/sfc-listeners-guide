Ben read a lot of theology especially by N. T. Wright and Dietrich Bonhoeffer

He switched his views on child baptism, communion as a sacrament, and justification being more corporate than individual.

Ben mentions a few distinguishing features of Catholicism:
- Apostolic succession 
- Rejection of Sola Scriptura (Bible plus church tradition)
- The Holy Spirit guides the church through ecumenical councils

Ben says one reason Catholics get a bad rap is confusion about salvation by works 

Ben transferred to a Catholic college before even considering converting
