<a class="timestamp tag is-medium is-primary" href="http://thescifichristian.com/2012/08/episode-79-the-sci-fi-catholic/#t=0:40">0:40</a> Ben jokes about changing the podcast's name to "The Sci-Fi Catholic". Matt made the same joke in â„– 69.

Matt lists some common stereotypes Protestants have about Catholics, like "Catholics are not Christians".

  <q class="matt">How surprised was Skip, our pastor?</q>
  <q class="ben">He was not surprised. He'd predicted it.</q>
  <q class="matt">He predicted that you were going to turn Catholic? Wow, I did not see the warning signs.</q>
</div>

Ben read a lot of theology especially by N. T. Wright and Dietrich Bonhoeffer.

He switched his views on child baptism, communion as a sacrament, and justification being more corporate than individual.

Ben mentions a few distinguishing features of Catholicism:
- Apostolic succession 
- Rejection of Sola Scriptura (Bible plus church tradition)
- The Holy Spirit guides the church through ecumenical councils

Ben says one reason Catholics get a bad rap is confusion about salvation by works.

Ben transferred to a Catholic college before even considering converting.

  <q class="ben">So I started to read the Catechism of the Catholic Church, and I started to read the apostolic fathers, so the earliest New Testament writings.</q>
  <q class="matt">You didn't put those on Goodreads. You were keeping them under wraps.</q>
  <q class="ben">Apostolic fathers is there. I have several books that I've read in the last several months that aren't on Goodreads.</q>
  <q class="matt">Oh my gosh, you were being sneaky!</q>
  <q class="ben">Well I thought that a book called {% workTitle "How to Go From a Good Evangelical to a Practicing Catholic in 95 Steps" %} might not--</q>
  <q class="matt">Might raise some red flags?</q>
  <q class="ben">--might raise some eyebrows.</q>

Ben says he may have time to podcast again.

  <q class="matt">Did it start with Jesus? Was Jesus the first pope?</q>
  <q class="ben">No, Peter was the first pope.</q>
  <q class="matt">People called him "papa"? "Papa Rock"?</q>

Ben also took up pipe smoking and cut off his ponytail.

  <q class="matt">I was already, as opposed to some evangelicals, I was pretty for Catholicism. Now I'm even more, cuz if Ben is for it, who can be against it?</q>

Ben says the deuterocanon was universally accepted by Christians until Martin Luther took it out of the Bible.

  <span class="quote-context tag is-size-6">Matt thinks it's more likely that Catholics have extraneous books in the Bible than that Protestants are missing books.</span>
  <q class="ben">Well but you guys took them out. They were in Protestant Bibles.</q>
  <q class="matt">Why would we take them out?</q>
  <q class="ben">Because Luther decided that I'll just pick and choose which books go along with my theology. Did you know he also took out Revelation, James...</q>
  <q class="matt">I know he hated James.</q>
  <q class="ben">...2 Peter, Jude, Hebrews...</q>
  <q class="matt">Yeah but look, that didn't stick. Because God was like: nah, we need James. 1 and 2 Macabees: they gots ta go.</q>
