Matt remembers to play the main topic Dr. Horrible transition music.

Koby reads from the Scientology website. 

Matt wants to know why people started joining a religion started by a science fiction writer.

Why would someone want to be a Christian and a scientologist? Daniel says it's because there's a lot of mystery in Christianity, and scientology promises all the answers.

Was L. Ron Hubbard sincere? 

Daniel was part of a human shield against Westboro Baptist church at a funeral.

Koby says there's a lot of scientologists and it's growing fast. <q class="archivist inline"><a href="https://medium.com/how-many-scientologists-are-there-really/counting-scientology-7-best-estimates-7746dc6d59aa">My brief research</a> says there are few Scientologists and it's shrinking.</q>
