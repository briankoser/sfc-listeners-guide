What books will still be read in hundreds of years?

Ben's definition of a classic: a transcendent work of genius

# Criteria
## Depth
1. Cultural
1. Thematic (the big questions of life)
1. Literary (in conversation with other literature)
1. Humanistic (what does it mean to be human)
1. Moral

## Poetry
- Great language, not necessarily verse
- Form

## Timelessness
The ability to communicate across time and space

Eric Weiner says that genius is fostered by suffering and are not evenly distributed by geography or time.
