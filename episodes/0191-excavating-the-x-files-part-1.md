notable_moments:

last_listen: 2019-04-10
recommendation: no
recommendation_reason: Skip unless you're a huge X-Files fan. For someone that's never seen the show, the story quickly gets incomprehensible (Chris Carter's fault, not the hosts).
archivist_note: I'm interested to see when the turning point of this series happens. Right now both hosts are positive and excited.
