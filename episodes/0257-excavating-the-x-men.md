  <q class="ben">I picked her because she's one of the more attractive X-Men.</q>
  <q class="matt">Right, but also a cartoon. And also a child.</q>
  <q class="ben">Oh. Kitty Pryde, off my list.</q>
  <q class="matt">So just let that sink in.</q>
  <q class="ben">I didn't know!</q>
  <q class="matt">I mean, she grows up.</q>
  <q class="ben">Yeah! In Joss Whedon's one she's grown up! That's what I remember! Come on!</q>
  <q class="matt">Yeah, in Joss Whedon's run she's awesome. More recently, she's taken on the mantle of one of the professors. So she's helps lead some young X-Men.</q>
  <q class="ben">She's totally grown up!</q>
