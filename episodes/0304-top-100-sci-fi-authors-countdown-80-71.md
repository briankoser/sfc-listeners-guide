    lines:
      - m: I have a question. When author's have the biography, do they write those themselves? 
      - b: Sometimes.
      - m: "Here's what it says: 'She is a fan of the internet--'"
      - benAction: "*laughs*"
      - m: '--freedom of information, Creative Commons, and Neil Gaiman.'
      - b: I'm sure she wrote that herself. No competent publisher would have written that.
      - m: You don't think the publishing house let her list 'internet' as her number one interest?
      - b: Uh, Katie, we gotta write your bio. What sort of things are you into?
      - m: Uh, I'd say the internet?
      - b: The internet and Neil Gaiman!
      - m: Okay, we're going to have to flesh this out. How do you feel about the freedom of information?
