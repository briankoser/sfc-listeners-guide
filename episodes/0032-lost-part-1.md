# Main Topic
After the pilot, Matt thought the monster on the island was a Dinosaur, which did not interest him. 
B little did you know that it was a man who got flushed down into a golden toilet in the middle of the jungle. 

The second, Kate-centric episode also did not interest him. 

The first Locke episode hooked him.

Matt says the show is very rewatchable.
M Just like the Bible, I'm always picking up new things along the way.

The <i class="work-title">LOST</i> mystery that drives Matt crazy is Christian Shephard appearing off the island.

They argue about if <i class="work-title">LOST</i> is the best TV show ever.

<div class="quote">

  <q class="matt"></q>
</div>
M I honestly can't think of a show that I think is better.
B OK, but you spent your life watching <i class="work-title">Quantum Leap</i>.

Ben suggests stopping recording and doing a LOST Part 2.
M I don't know if I necessarily have prepared enough for...
B Oh yeah, I will prepare some for that conversation.
M If we have a week, I will prepare some more.


Matt thinks "whatever happened, happened" is the best rule for time travel stories.
