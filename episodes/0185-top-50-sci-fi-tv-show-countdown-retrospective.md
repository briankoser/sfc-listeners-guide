recommendation: yes
recommendation_reason: Good wrapup to the countdown.
archivist_note: Ben occasionally has the verbal clutter of saying, "it's like", which I assumed he picked up from Jordan Peterson. Apparently not, since he says it in this episode, three years before Peterson became well known.
