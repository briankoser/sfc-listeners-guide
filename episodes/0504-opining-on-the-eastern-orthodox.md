For this discussion, apostolic succession is assumed.

{% work "His Broken Body" %} is a survey of Catholic and Eastern Orthodox differences from an Orthodox perspective.

# Eastern Orthodox differences from Roman Catholicism
## Minor Differences (allowed for Eastern Rite Catholics)

1. Married priests
2. Leavened bread for Eucharist
3. Location of the epiclesis in the liturgy

## Vatican II liturgical reforms

1. Priests facing ad orientum during Mass
2. Taking Eucharist in the hand
3. Altar girls
4. Devotional practices

## Moderate disagreements

1. No divorce in Catholicism
2. Marian dogmas
3. Original sin
4. Grace

Mary must have been perfect like the tabernacle. Therefore, she was sinless from conception.

## Big disagreements
1. Filioque clause in the Nicean Creed
2. Ecclesiology

The West emphasizes the oneness of God. The East emphasizes the threeness of God.

Both agree on apostolic succession and the visible church.

What is the pope? Primacy versus supremacy

Ben thinks neither side has an open-shut case for their ecclesiology.

Doesn't the Eastern Orthodox ecclesiology make schism inevitable?

If a pope made infallible statements that contradicted church teachings, that could prove Eastern Orthodox's ecclesiology, and Ben would consider switching.
