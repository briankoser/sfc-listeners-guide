# Opening
Biggest episode in SFC history, according to the hosts.



# Main Topic
C. K. is doing interviews with blogs and podcasts because mainstream media doesn't cover web content.

He talks about his philosophy of telling stories differently than everyone else.

He set up the design and cinematography of the show with the internet (different business model, audience) and iPhones (small screens) in mind.

Great history quick history of television
