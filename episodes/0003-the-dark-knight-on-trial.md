# News
At this point Ben is optimistic about genre movies and is excited for "More: more Pirates, more Matrix, more Nolan Batman".

B "I'm really glad they're rebooting Spider-Man."
M "Reboots are going to get really old really fast...I don't need to see Spider-Man become Spider-Man again."



# Main Topic
Is batman justified in his vigilantism?

General morality
Legality
Motive
Effectiveness

B we're talking about Jesus the man, not Jesus...
M oh you're going to separate Jesus now?

B all it takes for evil to Triumph is for good men to do nothing
M is that from a comic book?

M you can't say that Batman created all bad. Otherwise he would be called bad man.

B (on back to the future) I bet there's some really great spiritual themes in there
M absolutely. There has to be. It's from 1985



# Feedback
After feedback from "prostate gland problems", they turn on spam filter

B thank you prostate gland problems!
M thank you prostate

M is it a Sci-Fi prostate gland?
B I don't want any prostate related links going up on the website. Is that too much to ask?
