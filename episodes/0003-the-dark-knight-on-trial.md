# News
At this point Ben is optimistic about genre movies and is excited for "More: more Pirates, more Matrix, more Nolan Batman".

<q class="ben">I'm really glad they're rebooting Spider-Man.</q>
<q class="matt">Reboots are going to get really old really fast...I don't need to see Spider-Man become Spider-Man again.</q>

# Main Topic

There are four areas Batman must be justified:

1. General morality
2. Legality
3. Motive
4. Effectiveness

<q class="ben">We're talking about Jesus the man, not Jesus the God--</q>
<q class="matt">You can't separate them. Oh, you're going to separate Jesus now?</q>
</div>

<div class="quote">
<q class="ben">'All it takes for evil to triumph is for good men to do nothing.'</q>
<q class="matt">Is that from a comic book?</q>
</div>

<div class="quote">
<q class="matt">Even if you can say that Batman created supervillains (which I'm not even sure if you can 100% say that), you can't say that Batman created all bad. Otherwise he would be called 'Badman'.</q>

<div class="quote">
<span class="quote-context is-size-6">On <i class="work-title">Back to the Future</i></span>
<q class="ben">I bet there's some really great spiritual themes in there.</q>
<q class="matt">Absolutely. There has to be: it's from 1985.</q>

<div class="quote">
<q class="ben">Take that, Matt!</q>

</div>

<div class="quote">
<q class="matt">Is it a sci-fi prostate gland?</q>
