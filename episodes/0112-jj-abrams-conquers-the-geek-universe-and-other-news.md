Matt asks and Ben elucidates: "De Bono", capital "D", space before "Bono".

Ben loves {% work "Doctor Who" %} now.

Ben is going to restart the {% work "Game of Thrones" %} videos without Matt.

Take that, Science: an engineer petitioned the US Government to do a feasibility study on building a Starship Enterprise.

Gargoyles were for the illiterate, to tell them part of the Story, showing that there is evil outside the church, and to scare people.

Matt is anti-gargoyle, Ben is pro-gargoyle.

Ben wants Jack Black to be cast as Doctor Strange so the movie will bomb.

Ben wants to release a CD with all the SFC sound clips. 

Matt is disappointed that Aquaman is rumored to not appear in the Justice League movie.
