# Main Topic
Calvinism and Arminianism are not the only options

5-point and 7-point Calvinism

Does God have a plan? 

Did God ensure that Saul would accept him by appearing on the road to Damascus? Did that interfere with Saul's free will?

<div class="quote">
  <q class="matt">I'm guessing God had a good idea this was going to work out because there was a lot riding on Paul.</q>
  <q class="ben">Maybe there was a guy before Paul named Bob who was also persecuting Christians.</q>
  <q class="matt">He was the first choice.</q>
  <q class="ben">Yes.</q>
  <q class="matt">Paul was like the B team.</q>
  <q class="ben">Exactly.</q>
  <q class="matt">That's really sad.</q>
  <q class="ben">Bob the Pharisee on the road to Damascus. Jesus appears to him and, 'Eh'.</q>
</div>

Open Theism

Would it have been better for God to make all the choices for us?

Would you give up your free will if it meant everyone would be saved?

Is predestination unjust?

<div class="quote">
  <q class="ben">We're not "The Saving Private Ryan Christian", we're The Sci-Fi Christian, and it's not a sci-fi movie, so we shouldn't talk about it.</q>
  <q class="matt">We'll probably never ever talk about it again.</q>
  <q class="ben">We'll probably never talk about it again.</q>
</div>

<div class="quote">
  <q class="ben">Jesus was not a zombie, Jesus was not a clone...</q>
  <q class="matt">How else did he come back to life? </q>
</div>

<div class="quote">
  <q class="matt">People have to have free will.</q>
  <q class="ben">Hmm...</q>
</div>

DeBonism "invented" (God elects, and those elect have the responsibility to make more elect)



# Feedback

<div class="quote">
  <span class="quote-context is-size-6">One of Matt's friends told him that they stopped listening to the podcast because Matt and Ben talk over each other.</span>
  <q class="matt">So I threw something at them, and then kicked them. And that friendship is over.</q>
