Matt is cautiously optimistic about {% work "Jupiter Ascending" %}. Ben is not.

Matt predicts 3 stars for {% work "Mad Max: Fury Road" %}. Ben predicts 1 star, but he would see if it gets good reviews. 

Dan Simmons's {% work "The Fifth Heart" %} is coming out.

Matt knows he's never going to read {% work "The Wheel of Time" %} but he wants to discuss them on an episode.
