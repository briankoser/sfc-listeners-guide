NT Wright's Five Acts of God's Plan 

God's plan is to unite humanity as his covenant people, more than just saving individuals from hell.

Pentecost is the anti-Babel.

The Church's goal is to restore creation.

Matt is Right: new heaven and new earth is in Revelation chapter 21

Somehow the things we do today affect the new earth.

Ben says the rapture was invented 150 years ago. {% arc %}There were some vague beliefs before Darby in 1830, but the general point of it being a recent belief holds.{% endarc %}

Ben's beef with NT Wright: if Christ's mission was unification, why is it OK to be separate from the Catholic church? Protestantism is founded on the belief that it's OK to separate from the church. {% arc %}I think that's a mischaracterization; Luther didn't leave, he was excommunicated.{% endarc %}

Three options:
1. NT Wright is wrong
2. NT Wright is right, Sola Scriptura is right, and there's no way to resolve doctrinal differences
3. Jesus left an authority, the Apostles and their successors

  <span class="quote-context is-size-6">Ben says unity is the highest goal of the church.</span>
  <q class="ben">You have admitted that if that is true, then dividing the church is sinful. Where does that leave you as a Protestant?</q>
  <q class="matt">Well, I haven't personally divided any churches, so I feel good about myself.</q>
</div>

{% arc %}Unification is the ideal, but doctrinal correctness is a higher goal; otherwise, you would never excommunicate anyone.{% endarc %}

If you are protestant, are you perpetuating disunity? 

{% timeLink {url:podcast_file_url, t:'1:06:40'} %} Catholicism and Orthodoxy maintain apostolic succession and don't believe it's OK to exist in division. {% arc %}Divisions are a problem in Protestantism, but it's not uniquely Protestant; the Great Schism is the obvious example. With much smaller doctrinal differences, why is this division OK?{% endarc %}
