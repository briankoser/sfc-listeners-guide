Sermon Ben preached at Epic Life on 2011-06-19

[Romans 8:12-17](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=romans+8%3A12-17&version=ESV)

## How Knowing God as Father is Meant to Change Us
1. Being adopted into God's family changes your identity from a slave to a son
2. God becomes your Abba Father, changing your relationship
3. God can lead us with his Spirit
4. Knowing God as father gives us a stake in Christ's inheritance and changes our hope for the future
5. Changes our expectations for what life should look like: enduring suffering is part of being God's children
