# Opening
Ben coos like a dove in time with the opening music. 



# Main Topic
Ben suggests making the show's statute of limitations on spoilers 10 years.

Ben's idea for the opening of <i class="work-title">Star Wars: Episode VII</i>: the opening scrawl says there's a Gungan reunion party on Naboo. Then a Death Star nukes Naboo. Then there's a second scrawl and the movie goes from there.

Take That, Science: a "study" showed that red shirts died in greater numbers in TOS but not in greater number proportionally. Ben says that's the worst news ever reported on the show.



# Feedback
The hosts decide they can't read every piece of feedback any more.

Palindrome (one of the Blondeens) suggested the hosts live blog <i class="work-title">2001: A Space Odyssey</i> like they did for <i class="work-title">Lord of the Rings</i>.

Matt really wants to LARP once. Ben would do it.

Ben thinks <i class="work-title">Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell</i> is an awful book. <q class="archivist inline">😲 I'm re-reading it for a Hugo's There podcast; I think it's in my top 5 favorite books.</q>
