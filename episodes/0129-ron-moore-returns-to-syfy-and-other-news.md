Ben suggests making the show's statute of limitations on spoilers 10 years.

Ben's idea for the opening of {% workTitle "Star Wars: Episode VII" %}: the opening scrawl says there's a Gungan reunion party on Naboo. Then a Death Star nukes Naboo. Then there's a second scrawl and the movie goes from there.

Take That, Science: a "study" showed that red shirts died in greater numbers in {% workTitle "Star Trek: TOS" %} but not in greater number proportionally. Ben says that's the worst news ever reported on the show.



# Feedback
The hosts decide they can't read every piece of feedback any more.

Palindrome (one of the Blondeens) suggested the hosts live blog {% workTitle "2001: A Space Odyssey" %} like they did for {% workTitle "The Lord of the Rings" %}.

Matt really wants to LARP once. Ben would do it.

Ben thinks {% workTitle "Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell" %} is an awful book. <q class="archivist inline">ðŸ˜² I'm re-reading it for a Hugo's There podcast; I think it's in my top 5 favorite books.</q>
