Ben suggests making the show's statute of limitations on spoilers 10 years.

Ben's idea for the opening of {% work "Star Wars: Episode VII" %}: the opening scrawl says there's a Gungan reunion party on Naboo. Then a Death Star nukes Naboo. Then there's a second scrawl and the movie goes from there.

Ben says that's the worst news ever reported on the show.



# Feedback
The hosts decide they can't read every piece of feedback any more.

Palindrome (one of the Blondeens) suggested the hosts live blog {% work "2001: A Space Odyssey" %} like they did for {% work "The Lord of the Rings" %}.

Matt really wants to LARP once. Ben would do it.

Ben thinks {% work "Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell" %} is an awful book. 
{% arc %}One of my favorites. Ben changed his mind after a 2020 re-read.{% endarc %}
