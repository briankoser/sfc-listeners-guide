Ben was nice and didn't put any Daniel and Koby episodes on the list. 

<q class="archivist">This list contains 1 "essential" and 3 "listens". For me, the worst episodes are the ones that are forgettable; the worst so far might be {% episodeLink 128 %}, an hour and a half feedback episode containing almost nothing of note.</q>
