Matt questions using the main topic music now that episodes are split. 

King James Version translates Nephilim as "giants". 

Theories on who the Nephilim are:
- Fallen angels
- Children of fallen angels and women
  - The universal view until Augustine
- Children of lines of Seth and Cain
  - Augustine's view
- "Sons of God" were men created separately from Adam
- Vampires
  - Must be the sparkly type because women wanted to mate with them
- Children of men possessed by fallen angels
- Aliens

  <span class="quote-context is-size-6">Koby reads a passage from Jubilees 5 about the Nephilim</span>
  <q class="matt">Before you read on, can you talk about what The Apocrypha is and why we don't really believe it's true?</q>
  <q class="koby">No!</q>
  <q class="matt">Why?</q>
  <q class="koby">Cuz!</q>
  <q class="matt">Just give everybody some context for this.</q>
  <q class="koby">I don't give context.</q>
  <q class="matt">The Apocrypha is not authoritative.</q>
  <q class="koby">It's not in our official Bible.</q>
  <q class="matt">It's in the Catholic Bible.</q>
  <q class="koby">Catholic Bible. Sorry, Catholics.</q>
  <q class="matt">So some people do think it's from God, it's not though. So don't be fooled. This is not actually legit from God.</q>
  <q class="koby">OK, I think we got that out of the way now. I just didn't want to, you know, bash every Catholic in the world.</q>
  <q class="matt">Well, no. I'm onboard with Catholics. I just want to make sure that we know that this particular Bible is not from God, inspired by God.</q>
  <q class="koby">Thank you for pointing that out.</q>
  <q class="matt">Catholics are nice. That's all I'm saying.</q>
  <q class="daniel">Many of my friends are Catholic.</q>
  <q class="matt">I have Catholic friends, family members--</q>
  <q class="koby">I have Catholic friends.</q>
  <q class="matt">We definitely disagree on many theological positions, but, still kindly.</q>
  <q class="koby">We like Catholics. We'll just state that now.</q>
  <q class="matt">In fact, next week when you come back, we're actually going to be "The Sci-Fi Catholic".</q>
  <q class="koby">Oh my gosh no.</q>
  <q class="matt">Yeah! We're choosing a denomination. We're going denom.</q>
  <q class="koby">Why would we write "Catholic" then if we're denominational?</q>
  <q class="matt">Because we have chosen. Right now we're "The Sci-Fi Non-Denominational Christian".</q>
  <q class="koby">This is ridiculous.</q>

<q class="archivist inline">10 episodes after Matt randomly jokes about changing the title to "The Sci-Fi Catholic", Ben converts to Catholicism makes the same joke.</q>


Main theories are offspring of Seth and offspring of fallen angels

Can fallen angels take physical form? 

Matt argues that angels cannot reproduce, and also demons cannot reproduce, which would eliminate Nephilim being hybrid children. 

A possessed man fathering a child would not pass on "demon genes".

"Sons of God" in Job are angels

<q class="archivist inline">If you believe only Noah and his family survived the Flood, I think you'd have to believe that Goliath was not related to the Nephilim.</q> 

## Conclusion
- Daniel says they were tall people.
- Matt says they were the wicked children of godly men and ungodly men. 
- Koby agrees with Matt.
