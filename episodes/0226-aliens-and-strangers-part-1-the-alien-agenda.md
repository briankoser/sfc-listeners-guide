  <span class="quote-context is-size-6">Matt has been listening to Strangers and Aliens while travelling for work. Koby has never listened to an episode.</span>
  <q class="koby">That was just like The Sci-Fi Christian, what just happened.</q>
  <q class="ben">No, you listened before you came on.</q>
  <q class="koby">To, like, one episode. I lied to you guys.</q>
  <q class="matt">Aww.</q>
  <q class="ben">Why is he here?! OK, this episode is titled, "Goodbye Koby".</q>

Matt made the show theme with sample music from Soundtrack, the old version of Garage Band
