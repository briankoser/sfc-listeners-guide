George R. R. Martin is now worried that the Game of Thrones show will overtake his book series. 

Take That, Science: NASA is now accepting applications to mine the Moon

  <span class="quote-context is-size-6">Matt reads the article about mining the Moon</span>
  <q class="matt">Let me read on. 'Though countries are prohibited from claiming the Moon via the 1967 Outer Space Treaty of the United Nations'â€”which I wasn't aware of. Did you know about this?</q>
  <q class="ben">I didn't know. I thought we claimed the Moon; our flag's there.</q>

# Feedback
Ben listens to classical music and hates country and pop music. He likes Arcade Fire, Mumford and Sons, and Gregorian chant. 

{% timeLink podcast_file_url, '35:37' %} Matt names some pop bands to see if Ben has heard of them: Cobra and the Panthers, Two Head Fellinbergrade, Where's My Pants, Purple Shirts United, The Boxcar Children (big hit is "Come Home Now"), Black Belt or Brown Belt, and The Water Bottles. Ben figures out he's just making them up after Where's My Pants. <q class="archivist inline">Perfectly executed bit. Completely got me. Also, no idea what Matt is actually saying after "Two Head", let me know if you figure it out: {% timeLink podcast_file_url, '35:53' %}</q>

Matt likes a wide variety of music genres. He likes the Civil Wars, Matt Redman, All Sons and Daughters, Gungor, and David Crowder.
