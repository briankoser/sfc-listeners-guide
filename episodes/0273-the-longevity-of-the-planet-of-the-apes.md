  <q class="matt">I mean, if I had to sit down and watch {% work "Dawn of the Planet of the Apes" %}, I wouldn't be in misery, whereas I feel like if I had to sit down and watch the second one, {% work "Beneath" %}, I'd be in misery.</q>
  <q class="ben">So, let's just be clear: your qualifications for reaching number 3 on this list--</q>
  <q class="matt">In misery!</q>
  <q class="ben">--you wouldn't be in misery if you had to watch it.</q>
  <q class="matt">I'm starting to wonder--</q>
  <q class="ben">That's a high standard!</q>
  <q class="matt">So I'm wondering, as I made this list, I'm kind of wondering; I love the franchise, but the movies don't speak to that.</q>

Matt plays a clip from {% episodeLink 30 %} where Ben agrees to watch the entire franchise with him.
