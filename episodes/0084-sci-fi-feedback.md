  <q class="matt">Would you like to say the intro for this one?</q>
  <q class="koby">No.</q>
  <q class="matt">You sure? I'll let you. Pretty big honor.</q>
  <q class="koby">Um, I've never wanted to say an intro to anything ever.</q>
  <q class="matt">Say 'Sci-Fi Feedback'.</q>
  <q class="koby">Nah, I'm good.</q>

# Feedback
The Sci-Fi Feud 2012 has fizzled.

Francisco Rodriguez sent in a segment called "Reject or Resurrect". He decided that <a href="https://letterboxd.com/film/the-hobbit/">{% work "The Hobbit (1977)" %}</a> was a "reject". The plan is for it to be a monthly segment on feedback episodes. <q class="archivist inline">I'm guessing this is the only one.</q>

  <q class="matt">Rick Lee James, who has stolen Ben De Bono from The Sci-Fi Christian, has sent in a message. However, he sent this message on August 20th.</q>
  <q class="koby">He can keep him.</q>

Matt has not watched {% work "The Booth at the End" %} Season 2, but is planning to eventually. 

Greg in Iowa writes in with some good parallels between {% work "The Dark Knight Rises" %} and Christianity.

  <q class="matt">Bruce and Selina get a clean slate, like a new life in Christ! They get to start over fresh and are in a better place. Do you want to respond to any of these before I keep reading on?</q>
  <q class="koby">First of all, you're talking about the "better place" being Europe? Come on.</q>

  <q class="matt">Hey, you're from Iowa!</q>
  <q class="koby">Iowa! *singing* Oh I'm from I-owa, I-owa...</q>
  <q class="matt">What? What are you doing?</q>
  <q class="koby">It's an Iowan song. You don't understand.</q>
  <q class="matt">That was the weirdest thing I've ever heard.</q>
