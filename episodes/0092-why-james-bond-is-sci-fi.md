  <span class="quote-context is-size-6">The villain in {% work "Moonraker" %} takes a group of genetically perfect people to a space station and plans to kill everyone on Earth and start over.</span>
  <q class="daniel">So Koby is not there in the space station?</q>
  <q class="matt">No, Koby wouldn't be there in the space station.</q>

Daniel's favorite James Bond movie is {% work "The Spy Who Loved Me" %}.
Koby's favorite is {% work "Goldeneye" %}. 
Matt's favorite is {% work "Casino Royale" %}.

Daniel compares James Bond to Batman.

Is James Bond morally justified?
