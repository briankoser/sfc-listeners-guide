recommendation: yes
recommendation_reason: An interesting discussion about an interesting movie
archivist_note: For some reason Aronofsky movies just don't quite click for me; they feel artificial and forced, as opposed to, for example, David Lynch's, which feel natural and effortless. Not sure that I can explain why.
