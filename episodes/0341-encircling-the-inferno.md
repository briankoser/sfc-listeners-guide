    lines:
      - b: And they've got it relatively good, compared to their partner Judas Iscariot, who is head-in Satan. And so he's up to his waist in Satan, he's being chewed alive for all eternity, he's naked from the waist down, and Satan is clawing the flesh off of his body for all eternity.
      - m: It's horrific.
      - b: Probably wasn't worth those thirty pieces of silver there, Judas!
      - m: He didn't even keep it.
      - b: He should have at least bought himself something nice.
