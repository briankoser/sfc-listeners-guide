Ben and Matt are both reading <i class="work-title">Out of the Silent Planet</i> for the Strangers and Aliens book club. Both dislike the book. <q class="archivist inline">üëç</q>

  <q class="matt">I kind of have a personal goal that in my lifetime I want to read everything C. S. Lewis ever put out.</q>
  <q class="ben">You know that he wrote a lot of literary criticism as well that might not appeal to you.</q>
  <q class="matt">I mean, I don't always meet all my goals.</q>

# Feedback
Ben and Matt call foul on Chad picking <i class="work-title">The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</i> because it's not a trilogy <q class="archivist">Douglas Adams, with his droll sense of humor, continued to refer to the series as a trilogy even after he wrote the fourth and fifth books. The subtitles used in subsequent printings include "The Trilogy of Four", "A Trilogy in Five Parts", and "A Sixth Part in the Increasingly Inaccurate Hitchhiker's Trilogy".</q>

Aaron Reini names <i class="work-title">The Hobbit</i> movie trilogy "the most unnecessary trilogy". Ben says he could not disagree more after how good the first movie was.
