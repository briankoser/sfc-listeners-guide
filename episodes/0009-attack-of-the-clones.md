recommendation_reason: "\"The Dark Knight on Trial\" was the first iconic episode; \"Attack of the Clones\" is the first great episode. Prepare to have your mind expanded and your beliefs challenged."
archivist_note: "Ben says that conception is the only point that makes sense for us to say scientifically that life begins, and so this is when a soul enters a body. I think you could also make the case for when the heart starts beating. This gets around the question that identical twins pose: if the soul enters the body at conception, what happens when the twins split after a few days? Does another soul get created? Does the first soul split in two?"

Do clones have souls? 

Is a clone of a Christian also a Christian? 

How does original sin apply?

Did Jesus die for a human consciousness scanned into a computer? 



# Feedback
Based on Col. 1:20, Brady argues that aliens would have to be saved through the blood Jesus shed on the cross, rather than Jesus reincarnating as an alien and dying again for them.
