Ben Avery leaves feedback. He hosts a podcast called [Strangers and Aliens](http://strangersandaliens.com/). 

Matt accuses Strangers and Aliens of ripping them off: they talk about science fiction and Christianity, they have a "Ben", and they end their podcast by saying "signing off".

Ben cheated on Matt by appearing on the [Voices in My Head](https://rickleejames.podbean.com/) podcast with Rick Lee James. Matt starts playing the outro music since Ben already recorded a <i class="work-title">The Dark Knight Rises</i> episode.

Matt demands Dr. Jase of Strangers and Aliens be called "Matt" for one episode.

Bane is the opposite of Batman, even to the extent of having a mask that's the reverse of Batman's.

  <q class="matt">So Carl, keep me in mind. Keep listening, and if you let me stay with you and your family in Hawaii, I will bring you an official Sci-Fi Christian t-shirt.</q>
  <q class="ben">We don't have those, and don't let him come anywhere near you.</q>

What is the overall story of the Nolan Batman trilogy? 

Matt was mildly disappointed on the first view of the movie, liked it better on the second view.

  <q class="matt">What is Rick Lee James's podcast about? Why was he talking about Batman? I thought he was about music.</q>
  <q class="ben">Well he's just, he just brings on different intelligent, highly-entertaining, charismatic guests to talk about different topics.</q>
  <q class="matt">So it's not about music.</q>
  <q class="ben">Not exclusively. He'll have people who've written books on there, he'll have scholars on, he has musicians on, he has geniuses on. You know, he just brings on the best people. It's what he does.</q>
