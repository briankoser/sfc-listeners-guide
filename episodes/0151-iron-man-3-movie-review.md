Ben was offended by how the film handles Tony Stark's PTSD: it's introduced as a serious topic and then becomes a joke for the rest of the movie. 

Matt thinks the writers originally wanted to do the "Demon in the Bottle" storyline but Marvel didn't let them.

Ben thinks it's unbelievable that Trevor was promised anything he wanted and picked Budweiser, <q class="ben inline">A crappy beer</q>.

Killian had a Fin Fang Foom tattoo and blew fire. 

Ben tried to sleep in the theatre.

  <q class="matt">We're recommending: don't see it. And maybe then Marvel will get their act together and release some good stories.</q>
  <q class="ben">Boycott Marvel!</q>
  <q class="matt">I wouldn't go that far.</q>
