How we see our father influences how we see God 

[Romans 8:12-17](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=romans+8%3A12-17&version=ESV)

## How Knowing God as Father is Meant to Change Us
1. Being adopted into God's family changes your identity
2. God becomes your Abba Father, changing your relationship
3. God can lead us with his Spirit
4. Knowing God as father gives us a stake in Christ's inheritance and changes our hope for the future
5. Changes our expectations for what life should look like: enduring suffering is part of being God's children
