quotes:
  - time: "16:27"
    context: After the pilot, Matt thought the monster on the island was a dinosaur, which did not interest him.
    lines:
      - b: Little did you know that it was a man who got flushed down into a golden toilet in the middle of the jungle.
  - time: "33:18"
    context: Matt says the show is very rewatchable.
    lines:
      - m: Just like the Bible, I'm always picking up new things along the way.
  - time: "48:48"
    context: They argue about if LOST is the best TV show ever.
    lines:
      - m: I honestly can't think of a show that I think is better.
      - b: OK, but you spent your life watching Quantum Leap.
  - time: "50:04"
    context: Ben suggests stopping recording and doing a LOST Part 2.
    lines:
      - b: Here's what I was thinking cuz we're starting to, we're getting a little bit long and it's kinda late, what if we did a two-parter on this episode? What if we just keep going with this conversation. We come back next week and do spiritual elements then?
      - m: Come back and--I don't know if I necessarily have prepared enough for...
      - b: Oh yeah, I will prepare some for that conversation.
      - m: If we have a week, I will prepare some more.
  - time: "53:19"
    lines:
      - m: I instantly like people better if I know they like LOST. And I actually like them a little less if I know they don't like LOST.
  - time: "1:49:52"
    context: Would you torture someone to stop a terrorist attack? 
    lines:
      - b: If I was in a scenario like that, it's difficult to say that I wouldn't use whatever option I could to save the lives of countless people.
      - m: Would you cut off somebody's finger?
      - b: I said, whatever options available to me.
      - m: Would you cut off two of their fingers?
      - b: Maybe even three.
      - m: Oh my gosh. You're a monster!
  - time: "1:50:52"
    lines:
      - m: On the spot, without thinking it through too much, I'm pro-torture. Although I don't want to be tortured.
  - time: "1:51:20"
    lines:
      - m: I mean, I wouldn't torture just to mess with them. It would only be for information extraction.
      - b: "I'm glad we clarified that. 'Matt Anderson: not in favor of recreational torture'."
  - time: "1:53:29"
    lines:
      - b: Take that, Sayid!
  - time: "2:16:50"

# Opening

Ben says {% episodeLink 34 %} is by far their worst episode.



# LOST Part 1
{% quotes podcast_file_url, quotes[0] %}

The second, Kate-centric episode also did not interest him. 

The first Locke episode hooked him.

{% quotes podcast_file_url, quotes[1] %}

The {% work "LOST" %} mystery that drives Matt crazy is Christian Shephard appearing off the island.

{% quotes podcast_file_url, quotes[4] %}

Matt thinks "whatever happened, happened" is the best rule for time travel stories.
