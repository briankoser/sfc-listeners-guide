I started listening to The Sci-Fi Christian in December 2014 with Episode 296. Soon after, I started going back and listening to the old episodes that sounded interesting. That should have been sufficient, but was not:

- I wanted to share the great moments in SFC history with others, but could never remember in what episode they happened.
- I am compelled to catalogue and sort data.
- I am cursed to be a completionist.

For those reasons, in January 2018 I started listening to Episode 1 and compiling this guide. Instead of a transcript or show notes, the guide consists of items I found interesting. If there's anything you'd like me to add, please let me know.

Signing off,
