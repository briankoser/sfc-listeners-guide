I started listening to The Sci-Fi Christian at episode 3??. Soon after, I started going back and listening to the old episodes that sounded interesting. That should have been sufficient, but was not due to three factors:

- I wanted to share the great moments in SFC history with others, but could never remember in what episode they happened.
- I am compelled to catalogue and sort data.
- I am cursed to be a completionist.

For those reasons, at the beginning of AD 2018 I started listening to Episode 1. I'm enjoying listening to all the episodes, but I won't be relistening to everything again, and most people won't have time to do it once. And so the main purpose of this guide will be to recommend which episodes you listen to and which you skip. If you're not interested in hundreds of episodes, check out the essential episodes. If you have a bit more time, listen to all the recommended episodes. If you're a true completionist like me, please enjoy the commentary and data catalogued within.

I should also mention that this guide does not include show notes, unless I think they're of special interest. If there's anything you think should be added, please let me know.

Signing off,
The Archivist
