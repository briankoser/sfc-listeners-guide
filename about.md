I started listening to The Sci-Fi Christian in December 2014 with Episode â„– 296. Before long, I started listening to old episodes with interesting titles. That should have been sufficient, but:

- I wanted to share the great moments in SFC history with others, but could never remember in what episode they happened.
- I am compelled to catalogue and sort.
- I am cursed to be a completionist.

So in January 2018, I started listening to Episode 1 and compiling this guide. The plan was to grade each episode as "listen" or "skip" and write down only really notable events...but things soon got out of hand.

If there's anything you think I should add, please [email me at archivist@sfc.blue](mailto:archivist@sfc.blue) or [open an issue on Github](https://github.com/briankoser/sfc-listeners-guide/issues/new).

Signing off,
