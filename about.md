I started listening to The Sci-Fi Christian in December 2014 with Episode â„– 296. It wasn't long before I started listening to the old episodes with  interesting titles. That should have been sufficient, but was not:

- I wanted to share the great moments in SFC history with others, but could never remember in what episode they happened.
- I am compelled to catalogue and sort.
- I am cursed to be a completionist.

So in January 2018 I started listening to Episode 1 and compiling this guide. Instead of a transcript or show notes, the guide consists of items I found interesting. If there's anything you'd like me to add, please [email me at archivist@sfc.blue](mailto:archivist@sfc.blue) or [open an issue on Github](https://github.com/briankoser/sfc-listeners-guide/issues/new).

Signing off,
