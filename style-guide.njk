quotes:
  - time: "1:00:01"
    lines:
      - m: This is a quote with a timestamp.
      - b: Hi!
  - time: "1:00:02"
    context: This is a quote with a timestamp and long context
    lines:
      - m: A long, wrapping quote that will go to at least two lines so we may observe how that displays. It must be quite long for those extra-wide monitors that some prefer in this day and age.
      - benAction: "*sighs*"
  - time: "1:00:03"
    context: This is a very long context to test how we handle wrapping contexts when they are very long contexts as this context is, for a long context that wraps must be styled as nicely as a context that does not wrap, unlike this context.
    lines:
      - m: A simple quote.
  - time: "1:00:04"
    lines:
      - guest: Epictetus
        quote: It is impossible for anyone to begin to learn that which he thinks he already knows.
      - m: Very true.

    <blockquote>
        <p>All you've been saying is quite right, I shouldn't wonder. I'm a chap who always liked to know the worst and then put the best face I can on it. So I won't deny any of what you said. But there's one thing more to be said, even so. Suppose we have only dreamed, or made up, all those things--trees and grass and sun and moon and stars and Aslan himself. Supose we have. Then all I can say is that, in that case, the made-up things seem a good deal more important than the real ones. Suppose this black pit of a kingdom of yours is the only world. Well, it strikes me as a pretty poor one. And that's a funny thing, when you come to think of it. We're just babies making up a game, if you're right. But four babies playing a game can make a play-world which licks your real world hollow. That's why I'm going to stand by the play-world. I'm on Aslan's side even if there isn't any Aslan to lead it. <em>I'm going to live as like a Narnian as I can even if there isn't any Narnia.</em></p>
